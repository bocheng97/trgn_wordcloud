# A Brief Guide to Genomics

Genomics is the study of all of a person's genes (the genome), including
interactions of those genes with each other and with the person's environment.

## What is DNA?

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the chemical compound that contains the
instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of nearly all living
organisms. DNA molecules are made of two twisting, paired strands, often
referred to as a double helix

Each DNA strand is made of four chemical units, called nucleotide bases, which
comprise the genetic "alphabet." The bases are adenine (A), thymine (T),
guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Bases on opposite strands pair specifically: an
A always pairs with a T; a C always pairs with a G. The order of the As, Ts,
Cs and Gs determines the meaning of the information encoded in that part of
the DNA molecule just as the order of letters determines the meaning of a
word.

## What is a genome?

An organism's complete set of DNA is called its genome. Virtually every single
cell in the body contains a complete copy of the approximately 3 billion DNA
base pairs, or letters, that make up the human genome.

With its four-letter language, DNA contains the information needed to build
the entire human body. A gene traditionally refers to the unit of DNA that
carries the instructions for making a specific protein or set of proteins.
Each of the estimated 20,000 to 25,000 genes in the human genome codes for an
average of three proteins.

Located on 23 pairs of chromosomes packed into the nucleus of a human cell,
genes direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and
messenger molecules. Specifically, an enzyme copies the information in a
gene's DNA into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA
travels out of the nucleus and into the cell's cytoplasm, where the mRNA is
read by a tiny molecular machine called a ribosome, and the information is
used to link together small molecules called amino acids in the right order to
form a specific protein.

Proteins make up body structures like organs and tissue, as well as control
chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. If a cell's DNA is
mutated, an abnormal protein may be produced, which can disrupt the body's
usual processes and lead to a disease such as cancer.

## What is DNA sequencing?

Sequencing simply means determining the exact order of the bases in a strand
of DNA. Because bases exist as pairs, and the identity of one of the bases in
the pair determines the other member of the pair, researchers do not have to
report both bases of the pair.

In the most common type of sequencing used today, called sequencing by
synthesis, DNA polymerase (the enzyme in cells that synthesizes DNA) is used
to generate a new strand of DNA from a strand of interest. In the sequencing
reaction, the enzyme incorporates into the new DNA strand individual
nucleotides that have been chemically tagged with a fluorescent label. As this
happens, the nucleotide is excited by a light source, and a fluorescent signal
is emitted and detected. The signal is different depending on which of the
four nucleotides was incorporated. This method can generate 'reads' of 125
nucleotides in a row and billions of reads at a time.

To assemble the sequence of all the bases in a large piece of DNA such as a
gene, researchers need to read the sequence of overlapping segments. This
allows the longer sequence to be assembled from shorter pieces, somewhat like
putting together a linear jigsaw puzzle. In this process, each base has to be
read not just once, but at least several times in the overlapping segments to
ensure accuracy.

Researchers can use DNA sequencing to search for genetic variations and/or
mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease.
The disease-causing change may be as small as the substitution, deletion, or
addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of
bases.

## What is the Human Genome Project?

The Human Genome Project, which was led at the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) by the National Human Genome Research Institute, produced a very high-
quality version of the human genome sequence that is freely available in
public databases. That international project was successfully completed in
April 2003, under budget and more than two years ahead of schedule.

The sequence is not that of one person, but is a composite derived from
several individuals. Therefore, it is a "representative" or generic sequence.
To ensure anonymity of the DNA donors, more blood samples (nearly 100) were
collected from volunteers than were used, and no names were attached to the
samples that were analyzed. Thus, not even the donors knew whether their
samples were actually used.

The Human Genome Project was designed to generate a resource that could be
used for a broad range of biomedical studies. One such use is to look for the
genetic variations that increase risk of specific diseases, such as cancer, or
to look for the type of genetic mutations frequently seen in cancerous cells.
More research can then be done to fully understand how the genome functions
and to discover the genetic basis for health and disease.

## What are the implications for medical science?

Virtually every human ailment has some basis in our genes. Until recently,
doctors were able to take the study of genes, or genetics, into consideration
only in cases of birth defects and a limited set of other diseases. These were
conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, which have very simple, predictable
inheritance patterns because each is caused by a change in a single gene.

With the vast trove of data about human DNA generated by the Human Genome
Project and other genomic research, scientists and clinicians have more
powerful tools to study the role that multiple genetic factors acting together
and with the environment play in much more complex diseases. These diseases,
such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease constitute the majority
of health problems in the United States. Genome-based research is already
enabling medical researchers to develop improved diagnostics, more effective
therapeutic strategies, evidence-based approaches for demonstrating clinical
efficacy, and better decision-making tools for patients and providers.
Ultimately, it appears inevitable that treatments will be tailored to a
patient's particular genomic makeup. Thus, the role of genetics in health care
is starting to change profoundly and the first examples of the era of genomic
medicine are upon us.

It is important to realize, however, that it often takes considerable time,
effort, and funding to move discoveries from the scientific laboratory into
the medical clinic. Most new drugs based on genome-based research are
estimated to be at least 10 to 15 years away, though recent genome-driven
efforts in lipid-lowering therapy have considerably shortened that interval.
According to biotechnology experts, it usually takes more than a decade for a
company to conduct the kinds of clinical studies needed to receive approval
from the Food and Drug Administration.

Screening and diagnostic tests, however, are here. Rapid progress is also
being made in the emerging field of pharmacogenomics, which involves using
information about a patient's genetic make-up to better tailor drug therapy to
their individual needs.

Clearly, genetics remains just one of several factors that contribute to
people's risk of developing most common diseases. Diet, lifestyle, and
environmental exposures also come into play for many conditions, including
many types of cancer. Still, a deeper understanding of genetics will shed
light on more than just hereditary risks by revealing the basic components of
cells and, ultimately, explaining how all the various elements work together
to affect the human body in both health and disease.

enabling medical researchers to develop improved diagnostics, more effective
therapeutic strategies, evidence-based approaches for demonstrating clinical
efficacy, and better decision-making tools for patients and providers.
Ultimately, it appears inevitable that treatments will be tailored to a
patient's particular genomic makeup. Thus, the role of genetics in health care
is starting to change profoundly and the first examples of the era of genomic
medicine are upon us.

It is important to realize, however, that it often takes considerable time,
effort, and funding to move discoveries from the scientific laboratory into
the medical clinic. Most new drugs based on genome-based research are
estimated to be at least 10 to 15 years away, though recent genome-driven
efforts in lipid-lowering therapy have considerably shortened that interval.
According to biotechnology experts, it usually takes more than a decade for a
company to conduct the kinds of clinical studies needed to receive approval
from the Food and Drug Administration.

Screening and diagnostic tests, however, are here. Rapid progress is also
being made in the emerging field of pharmacogenomics, which involves using
information about a patient's genetic make-up to better tailor drug therapy to
their individual needs.

Clearly, genetics remains just one of several factors that contribute to
people's risk of developing most common diseases. Diet, lifestyle, and
environmental exposures also come into play for many conditions, including
many types of cancer. Still, a deeper understanding of genetics will shed
light on more than just hereditary risks by revealing the basic components of
cells and, ultimately, explaining how all the various elements work together
to affect the human body in both health and disease.

# Masters of Science in Translational Biotechnology



  * [Admissions Requirements](http://mgm.ufl.edu/academics/programs/masters-of-science-programs/master-of-science-in-translational-biotechnology/admission-requirements/)
  * [Masters of Science in Translational Biotechnology Handbook](http://mgm.ufl.edu/files/2014/07/Masters-of-Science-in-Translational-Biotechnology-Handbook.pdf)



The Science Master’s Program in Translational Biotechnology is a two-year
thesis program that is interdisciplinary (biosciences and business), is
research intensive, has deep industry involvement, and includes a formal
internship at a company. Students will graduate with a major (Master of
Science in Medical Sciences) and a grad Minor in Entrepreneurship limited to
GEB, ENT and FIN courses . The Masters of Science Program in Translational
Biotechnology has the support of the Provost, the Vice President for Research,
and Deans of the Colleges of Medicine and Business Administration.

The Program is focused on applied and translational research. Translational
Biotechnology includes drug/biologics/device product development,
manufacturing process development, assay development, toxicology studies,
quality systems (quality control and quality assurance), clinical trial
support, and regulatory compliance. These activities are essential for testing
new drugs/biologics/devices in humans and their subsequent commercialization.
Translational Biotechnology activities are foundational for companies, and are
increasingly gaining importance in the academic setting where new technologies
are being tested in humans prior to entering the commercial sector. Courses
incorporated into this unique Program encompass biotechnology science together
with regulatory compliance and best business practices. Graduate courses in
product development, regulatory compliance (cGMPs/GTPs/GLPs/GCPs), quality
systems (Quality control and Quality Assurance), process development,
analytical product testing, and biomanufacturing are essential topics for
creating scientists capable of sustaining translational research and
commercialization. Product development of biotechnological or biomedical
products including biopharmaceuticals; diagnostic test materials; enzymes,
antibodies, and other protein products; transgenic plants and animals; tissue
and cellular products, and biomedical implants and devices requires that
scientists have the knowledge to carefully complete procedures in compliance
with foreign and domestic regulations. Other features of the program are the
infusion of personal and professional skills (communication, documentation,
teamwork, interviewing, work ethic, etc), ethics and responsible conduct of
research, and international perspectives.

Deadline for applications is March 31 of the current year fall
admission.Applicants must meet the minimum requirements for the University of
Florida Graduate School: GPA 3.0 and a score on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE)
of 1000 Combined verbal and quantitative for the old scale, and a minimum
score of 300 for the new scale. Note that for students accepted into the
Masters the average GPA is 3.5, GRE is 310 (new) or 1220 (old). The program
requirements 3 letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose and
“official” transcripts.

#### Education and training

A foundation of the Program is a high-quality research project under the
direction of a skilled mentor, with supervision by a committee composed of
members of the University’s Graduate Research Faculty. Specialization may be
in any of the fields of research being pursued in the College of Medicine or
local biotechnology company.  During the first year of the program, students
will enroll in lecture courses and seminar course, and will begin working in a
mentor’s laboratory. The content of the lecture courses is intended to address
a need for a strong foundation in advanced level biology and chemistry that is
applied to biotechnology and biomedical product development. Courses are
available that bridge basic life sciences and applied research, and these have
been brought together with courses in business. Both the seminar series and
the lecture courses provide preparation for Master’s research which should be
well underway by the end of the second semester. The second year of graduate
study for the student is devoted to finishing the required courses and doing
research. Students may also enroll in additional courses, according to their
interests and backgrounds. Following the four semesters of coursework and
research, the students will be placed into internships companies not limited
to Flordia. Students will work together with steering committee members to
review available companies and associated projects, and a match will be made.

#### Degree Requirements:

Completion of the degree will require a total of 48 credit hours with 36
credit hours comprising biomedical coursework, laboratory research, and
internship for the major and 6 hours of business coursework for the minor.
Students will chose from several courses and course modules available at the
COM within the scope of the Program (student course choices will be reviewed
by the mentor, program coordinator, and program Director), and for the
business courses, students choose six credits from several options. These
courses are taught in seven week blocks. The courses include: financial
accounting, finance, economics, entrepreneurship, law, marketing, management,
and operations. An example of a program of study is shown in the table below,
and is not limited to the courses listed.

The biomedical and business courses are brought together to create the
curriculum in the table above. In the classroom, students will learn the
profiles of major departments/areas (marketing, sales, finance,
administration, HR, production, manufacturing support, QC/QA, research and
development, regulatory affairs, clinical affairs, etc.), the operations of
each, and how they interact with each other and outside organizations. Each
key operation will be presented in a collection of learning media (classroom,
internet-based, case studies). The curriculum is focused on the regulatory
agencies, the regulations, developing & implementing quality systems,
regulatory compliance, document development, documentation systems and
control, process & facilities control, product release, auditing,
specifications setting, biologics/tissue/device /pharmaceutical manufacturing
technology, maintenance and calibration, process development/optimization,

# Translational research

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to navigation Jump to search

Effort to build on basic scientific research

Not to be confused with [Translation studies](/wiki/Translation_studies).

**Translational research** – a term often used interchangeably with **translational medicine** or **translational science** or **bench to bedside** – is an effort to build on [basic scientific research](/wiki/Basic_research) to create new [therapies](/wiki/Therapies),[1] [medical procedures](/wiki/Medical_procedure), or [diagnostics](/wiki/Diagnostic). Basic [biomedical research](/wiki/Biomedical_research) is based on studies of [disease processes](/wiki/Pathophysiology) using, for example, [cell cultures](/wiki/Cell_culture) or [animal models](/wiki/Animal_model).[2] The [adjective](/wiki/Adjective) "translational" refers to the "[translation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/translation)" (the term derives from the [Latin](/wiki/Latin) for "carrying over") of basic scientific findings in a laboratory setting into potential treatments for disease.[3][4][5][6]

## Definitions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Translational_research&action=edit&se
ction=1)]

Translational medicine is defined by the European Society for Translational
Medicine (EUSTM) as "an interdisciplinary branch of the biomedical field
supported by three main pillars: benchside, bedside and community."[2]

It is defined for school-based education by the Education Futures
Collaboration (www.meshguides.org) as research which translates concepts to
classroom practice.[7] Examples of translational research are commonly found
in education subject association journals and in the MESHGuides which have
been designed for this purpose.[8]

Translational research applies findings from basic science to enhance human
health and well-being. Translational research adopts a scientific
investigation/ enquiry into a given problem facing medical/health practices to
surmount such problem which will helps to raise aggregate health
performance.[9] In a medical research context, it aims to "translate" findings
in fundamental research into medical practice and meaningful health outcomes.
Translational research implements a "bench-to-bedside", from laboratory
experiments through clinical trials to point-of-care patient applications,[10]
model, harnessing knowledge from basic sciences to produce new drugs, devices,
and treatment options for patients. The end point of translational research is
the production of a promising new treatment that can be used with practical
applications, that can then be used clinically or are able to be
commercialized.[3]

As a relatively new research discipline, translational research incorporates
aspects of both basic science and clinical research, requiring skills and
resources that are not readily available in a basic laboratory or clinical
setting. Translational research is conceived due to the elongated time often
taken to bring to bear discovered medical idea in practical terms in a health
system.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_] It is for these
reasons that translational research is more effective in dedicated university
science departments or isolated, dedicated research centers.[11] Since 2009,
the field has had specialized journals, the _[American Journal of
Translational Research](/wiki/American_Journal_of_Translational_Research)_ and
_[Translational Research](/wiki/Translational_Research_\(journal\))_ dedicated
to translational research and its findings.

Translational research is broken down into different stages, including two-
stage (T1 and T2), four-stage (T1, T2, T3, and T4), and five-stage (T1, T2,
T3, T4, and T5) schemes. In a two-stage model, _T1 research_, refers to the
"bench-to-bedside" enterprise of translating knowledge from the basic sciences
into the development of new treatments and _T2 research_ refers to translating
the findings from clinical trials into everyday practice.[3] In a five-stage
scheme, T1 involves basic research, T2 involves pre-clinical research, T3
involves clinical research, T4 involves clinical implementation, and T5
involves implementation in the public health sphere. Waldman et al. propose a
scheme going from T0 to T5. T0 is laboratory (before human) research. In
T1-translation, new laboratory discoveries are first translated to human
application, which includes phase I & II clinical trials. In T2-translation,
candidate health applications progress through clinical development to
engender the evidence base for integration into clinical practice guidelines.
This includes phase III clinical trials. In T3-translation, dissemination into
community practices happens. T4-translation seeks to (1) advance scientific
knowledge to paradigms of disease prevention, and (2) move health practices
established in T3 into population health impact. Finally, T5-translation
focuses on improving the wellness of populations by reforming suboptimal
social structures.[12]

In a two-stage scheme, translational research includes two areas of
translation. One is the process of applying discoveries generated during
research in the laboratory, and in preclinical studies, to the development of
trials and studies in humans. The second area of translation concerns research
aimed at enhancing the adoption of best practices in the community. Cost-
effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies is also an important part
of translational science.[3]

## Comparison to basic research or applied research[[edit](/w/index.php?title=
Translational_research&action=edit&section=2)]

[Basic research](/wiki/Basic_research) is the systematic study directed toward
greater [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge) or understanding of the fundamental
aspects of [phenomena](/wiki/Phenomena) and is performed without thought of
practical ends. It results in general knowledge and understanding of nature
and its laws.[13]

Applied research is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical
application of [science](/wiki/Science). It accesses and uses the research
communities' accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a
specific, often state, [business](/wiki/Commerce), or [client-
driven](/wiki/Customer) purpose.[14]

In medicine, translational research is increasingly a separate research field.
A citation pattern between the applied and basic sides in cancer research
appeared around 2000.[15]

## Challenges and criticisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Translational_research&
action=edit&section=3)]

Critics of translational research (to the exclusion of more basic research)
point to examples of important drugs that arose from fortuitous discoveries in
the course of basic research such as [penicillin](/wiki/Penicillin) and
[benzodiazepines](/wiki/Benzodiazepines),[16] and the importance of basic
research in improving our understanding of basic biological facts (e.g. the
function and structure of [DNA](/wiki/DNA)) that go on to transform applied
medical research.[17]

Examples of failed translational research in the pharmaceutical industry
include the failure of anti-aβ therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease.[18] Other
problems have stemmed from the widespread irreproducibility thought to exist
in translational research literature.[19]

## Facilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Translational_research&action=edit&sec
tion=4)]

In U.S., the [National Institutes of
Health](/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health) has implemented a major national
initiative to leverage existing academic health center infrastructure through
the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. The [National Center for
Advancing Translational
Sciences](/wiki/National_Center_for_Advancing_Translational_Sciences) (NCATS)
was established on December 23, 2011.[20]

Although translational research is relatively new, it is being recognized and
embraced globally. Some major centers for translational research include:

  * About 60 hubs of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards program.[21]
  * [Translational Research Institute (Australia)](/wiki/Translational_Research_Institute_\(Australia\)), [Brisbane, Queensland](/wiki/Brisbane,_Queensland), [Australia](/wiki/Australia).
  * [Stanford University Medical Center](/wiki/Stanford_University_Medical_Center), [Stanford, California](/wiki/Stanford,_California), United States.
  * [Translational Genomics Research Institute](/wiki/Translational_Genomics_Research_Institute), [Phoenix, Arizona](/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona), United States.
  * [Maine Medical Center](/wiki/Maine_Medical_Center) in [Portland, Maine](/wiki/Portland,_Maine), United States has a dedicated translational research institute.[22]
  * [Scripps Research Institute](/wiki/Scripps_Research_Institute#Scripps_Florida), [Florida](/wiki/Florida), United States, has a dedicated translational research institute.[23]
  * [UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center](/wiki/UC_Davis), [Sacramento, California](/wiki/Sacramento,_California)[24]
  * [Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh](/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh), [Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania)[25]

Additionally, translational research is now acknowledged by some universities
as a dedicated field to study a PhD or graduate certificate in, in a medical
context. These institutes currently include [Monash
University](/wiki/Monash_University) in [Victoria,
Australia](/wiki/Victoria,_Australia),[26] the [University of
Queensland](/wiki/University_of_Queensland), Diamantina Institute in
[Brisbane, Australia](/wiki/Brisbane,_Australia),[27] at [Duke
University](/wiki/Duke_University) in [Durham, North
Carolina](/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina), [America](/wiki/United_States),[28]
at [Creighton University](/wiki/Creighton_University) in [Omaha,
Nebraska](/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska)[29] at [Emory
University](/wiki/Emory_University) in [Atlanta,
Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia),[30] and at [31][The George Washington
University](/wiki/The_George_Washington_University) in [Washington,
D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.). The industry and academic interactions to
promote translational science initiatives has been carried out by various
global centers such as [European Commission](/wiki/European_Commission),
[GlaxoSmithKline](/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline) and [Novartis](/wiki/Novartis)
Institute for [Biomedical Research](/wiki/Biomedical_Research).[32]

## Main

I want to thank you very much for giving me the honor of serving you as the
President of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) during 2001 and
2002. I consider myself extremely privileged for you to have placed your trust
in me.

The ACMG is the organization within clinical genetics that is responsible for
education and policy. Last year in my presidential address I argued that we
blend exacting science with compassion and advocacy in the care of our
patients, and we must work individually and collectively to ensure full and
equal access to genetic information and genetic health
professionals.[1](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR1) This year I will discuss the
critical need for medical geneticists to be the leaders in translating genomic
information for practical medical use.

The premise underlying my presentation is that for the Human Genome Project to
have its fullest impact, its products in the form of sequence and concepts
must be translated for use in clinical medicine. Translational genomics will
be the result of this endeavor, and medical geneticists should be the leaders
in this arena.

The success of translational genomics will depend on our ability to discern
the complexity of interactions among genes, gene products, and the
environment. A full understanding of this complexity will depend upon new ways
of considering genetics in the genomic era. This will require an intermingling
of concepts from biology, engineering, and information systems, and
comparisons within and between genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and
metabolomes.

We are already seeing a shifting focus in medical genetics from rare to common
diseases. I will argue, however, that translational genomics teaches us that
the differences between rare and common diseases are not so extreme, because
in fact there are a multitude of genotypes for “common disease” phenotypes. If
we are to improve significantly the care of our patients with rare and common
genetic diseases, then we must develop collaborative, multi-institutional,
protocol-driven clinical studies.

### Human Genome Project and translational genomics

Genetics has come a long way in less than 50 years, from the original
identification of the double helical structure of DNA by Watson and
Crick[2](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR2) in April 1953, to the drafts of the
human genome published by the public[3](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR3) and
private[4](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR4) efforts in February 2001.

Initiated in 1990, the completion of the public Human Genome Project was
originally planned for 2005. However, the finished sequence is anticipated for
spring 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Watson and Crick
publication.[2](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR2)

The results of the Human Genome Project will involve not only the complete
sequencing of the human genome, but also the creation of a new branch of
science and medicine, genomics, as well as a series of derivative disciplines.
If a genome is all of the DNA for an organism, then genomics is the study of
that genome and its implications. Derivative disciplines include
transcriptomics, the study of the transcriptome, representing all of the
transcripts or RNA copies of the genes in a cell, tissue, or individual;
proteomics, the study of the proteome, representing all of the proteins in a
cell, tissue, or individual; and metabolomics, the study of the metabolome,
representing all of the molecular components of a cell, tissue, or individual
that are produced by the proteins of the proteome. Additional derivative
disciplines are being and will continue to be described.

Genomics, its derivative disciplines, and the synthesis of this information
will generate the complete parts' lists and the parts' assembly instructions
for a fully functioning organism.

The promise of the Human Genome Project is improved diagnosis and treatment
through the application of genomic information and technologies, leading to
predictive medicine and individualized medical care.[5](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR5) Genomic medicine will be predictive rather than reactive. It will be
preventive in its philosophical orientation, rather than the more traditional
medical approach of responding only after acute presentation. The predictive
and preventive nature of genomic medicine will lead to screening of
populations, subpopulations, and individuals for genetic predispositions to
rare and common disorders.

Medical geneticists should be the translators for genomic medicine. The ACMG,
with its roles in education and policy formation, gives our membership the
venue in which to organize these translational efforts. We must prepare
ourselves for our roles in translational genomics by addressing the complexity
of biological systems.

### Complexity of interactions between genes, gene products, and environment

The disciplines of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are
already changing our concepts regarding the organization of biological
systems. Many of us thought of biochemical pathways as an interconnection of
enzymes and metabolites in a relatively homogeneously connected network. We
have learned that such systems are referred to as exponential networks, in
which the probability of a node's having increasing connectivity falls as an
exponential function.[6](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR6),[7](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR7) Robust biological and human-designed systems have the hub-and-spoke
architecture of scale-free networks. These scale-free networks are more
heterogeneous in their connectivity, with most nodes having one or a very few
contacts, and only rare nodes being highly connected. Examples of scale-free
networks include the Internet[6](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR6) and natural
proteomes.[8](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR8)

Scale-free networks are highly robust, meaning that it is difficult to
fragment such networks.[7](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR7) Communications between
nodes are unaffected by very high failure rates, since most of the nodes have
very low connectivity. If a node is lost, then there is a very high
probability that this node will have been connected to only one other node,
and while this connection will fail, there is a very low probability that the
overall function of the network will be compromised.

The structural features that give scale-free networks their robust properties,
however, are also the source of their vulnerability. The highly connected
nodes, although quite rare, are critical to network function. Failure of these
highly connected nodes, such as by a mutation in a biological scale-free
network, will fragment the network and threaten the survival of the network.
Considerations of the error and attack tolerance, as well as the
vulnerabilities of scale-free networks, are essential to our understanding of
the pathogenesis of genetic diseases.[7](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR7),[9](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR9) Such considerations require a global
view of an organism's functional components and their integration, informed,
for example, by a knowledge of that organism's genome, transcriptome,
proteome, and metabolome.

#### Intermingling of biology, engineering, and information systems

Our thinking about the complexity of cellular and organismic biology will
require us to move from molecular to modular concepts.[10](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR10) Within this modular view of biology, the components will have
properties that we will recognize to be similar to those in engineering and
computer science. Recent evidence has shown that a biological system may be
constructed that will function as an oscillator[11](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR11) or a toggle switch.[12](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR12) This modular view
of biology will require the formulation of new models and general principles
if we are to achieve an improved ability to appreciate and manipulate these
functional modules.[10](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR10)

The Human Genome Project is also bringing about major changes in
bioinformatics. Many think that, while the sequencing efforts represent a
major scientific accomplishment, the real “genomics revolution” is in the
ability to manage and analyze the information contained within the sequence.
The ongoing efforts in sequencing and informatics will permit translation for
improved medical care, although there is a substantial amount of work to be
done before practicable translation is available to individuals.

If the sequencing of an individual's genome would be available for $1,000,
then let us consider some of the issues that would accompany the translation
of this information for medical decision-making by that individual. For any
data acquisition there is inevitably an error rate, and this will be true for
genomic sequence. Even if the error rate is quite low, the size of the genome
is such that numerous errors are anticipated until the cost is so low that
multiple repetitions are possible. For example, if sequencing is 99.99%
accurate, this would result in an error every 10,000 nucleotides, or with a
human genome of approximately 3.2 billion base pairs the number of errors
would exceed 300,000. Interpretation of sequence variation between individuals
would have to consider differences due to technical errors as well as natural
polymorphisms. In addition, interpretation of an individual's genomic sequence
will require a better understanding of complexity in biology, from the
multiple functions of individual proteins to a modular view of biological
networks. Beyond the technical and biological considerations in the use of the
genomic sequence information are ethical, legal, and social issues. The cost
of $1,000 that we have set arbitrarily would be affordable for some and
absolutely inaccessible for others. For those who could afford to have their
genomes sequenced, there would be the issues of privacy and discrimination,
and how this information could be stored in a manner that would ensure
fidelity and accessibility without compromising
insurability.[1](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR1)

#### Comparisons within and between genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and
metabolomes

Comparisons of sequences within and between organisms may be quite powerful.
Such comparisons are quite common and useful for DNA coding sequences and
deduced amino acid sequences, for which similarities and differences define
and distinguish, for example, functional domains and gene families.
Comparisons among noncoding sequences may identify and distinguish regulatory
elements. Other conserved blocks of noncoding sequences are being recognized,
but for many of these conserved regions their functions remain to be
identified. A fuller understanding of function and interrelationships
throughout the genome, transcriptome, and proteome and their impact on the
metabolome will be required for interpretation of sequence differences within
an individual's genome.

Functional comparisons must be made at all levels, but at this time are
focusing on the proteome and metabolome. Studies in microorganisms can give us
insight into principles underlying the robustness of all biological systems.
Growth of _Escherichia coli_ on glucose was analyzed to determine which
enzymes contributed most strongly to the robust properties of this metabolic
system.[13](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR13) Flux limits for enzymatic reactions
were examined below which growth on glucose was compromised, and these enzymes
were classified into three groups: pentose phosphate pathway, three-carbon
glycolytic pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. For the pentose phosphate
pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle, growth was not compromised until
residual flux fell to ≈15–30% of normal. For the three-carbon glycolytic
pathway, however, growth was compromised when flux fell to only 63% of normal,
indicating that this region of metabolism was much more sensitive to
variation. Therefore, while growth of _E. coli_ on glucose is in general a
highly robust property, not all components are equally resistant to
perturbation.

Comparisons of the large-scale organization of metabolic networks between
organisms also may give insight into the robustness of biological systems. The
metabolic networks of 43 organisms were compared quantitatively for 43
organisms representative of archae, bacteria, and
eukaryotes.[14](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR14) Significant differences in the
pathways were observed among these organisms, but the overall design
properties were quite similar. The investigators speculated that the scale-
free topological organization was the common design-element in these organisms
and that this organization contributed to the common feature of robust
tolerance to variation among these very different organisms.

#### _DAX1_ deficiency and pertubation in a complex network

Dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenta, on the X
chromosome, gene 1 (_DAX1_), is the nuclear receptor family member encoded by
the _NROB1_ gene.[15](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR15) Loss of _DAX1_ function by
deletion or point mutation causes disruption of the normal development of the
steroidogenic axis leading to adrenal hypoplasia congenita associated with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The key question is how the loss of a single
gene product results in the compromise of a robust developmental system.

Traditionally we have thought of blocks in metabolic pathways as analogous to
the damming of a flow of water with a buildup behind the dam and overflow into
side channels, and of blocks in transcriptional cascades as interruption of
signal transfer. Consideration of the complexity of developmental networks,
however, gives us a different view of the effects of mutations. _DAX1_ is a
node in a complex network with a high level of
connectivity.[16](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR16) Loss of _DAX1_ function would
not simply compromise a one-dimensional transcriptional cascade, but we would
speculate that mutation of _DAX1_ would compromise the function of each of the
transcription factors distal to it in the network, and therefore an entire
sector of the transcriptional network would be lost.[16](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR16)

### Shifting focus from rare to common diseases

Some consider the shift in focus within medical genetics from rare, Mendelian
diseases to common, complex disorders as a paradigm shift. We must consider,
however, that rare and common disorders, or “single” gene and multigenic
diseases, respectively, represent points on a continuum and not distinct
entities.[9](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR9),[17](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR17)–[19](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR19)

#### Multitude of genotypes even for common disease phenotypes

Complexity is the rule for the phenotypes of “simple” Mendelian traits, as
well as for common, multigenic disorders.[9](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR9),[17](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR17)–[20](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR20) In
a Mendelian or “single” gene disorder, there is one gene that exerts a primary
effect, but the phenotype in the individual patient is influenced by
additional modifier genes.[17](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR17)–[19](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR19) As a single gene loses its primary
effect and the influences of two or more genes begin to be approximately
coequal, the disorder is recognized as multigenic. Such multigenic diseases
may also be referred to as “complex” diseases, but this terminology denies the
fundamental complexity of the “single” gene diseases. The major portion of the
common disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes
mellitus, are presumed to be multigenic with superimposition of environmental
influences.

Since the phenotypes of the “simple” Mendelian disorders represent the
influences of the primary genetic abnormality and additional modifier genes,
and those for multigenic disorders clearly involve the influences of multiple
genes, and both have additional environmental influences, therefore the
phenotypes of individuals in all categories of genetic disorders will be
determined by the individuals' extended genotypes. In other words, each
individual, regardless of the type of genetic disease they experience, are
influenced by their unique genotype and environmental experience.

For Mendelian disorders, although there may be a group of modifier genes that
may influence the phenotype, not every modifier gene will be involved in each
patient. Similarly, for the multigenic disorders, if there are large groups of
genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis, only a subset of these will be
involved in any individual patient. Therefore, any genetic disease will be
composed of individuals with rare composite genotypes, and we can develop
similar approaches for the acquisition of an evidence base across all genetic
disorders.

#### Development of collaborative, multi-institutional, protocol-driven
clinical studies

The use of clinical studies involving collaborations between multiple
institutions with strict adherence to protocols developed by consensus among
the participating investigators represents the approach that will optimize
progress toward a sound evidence base when individual patients are rare. We
have determined that even for common disorders, those with an identical
composite genotype will be rare; therefore, such an approach will be just as
valid for rare disorders as for common diseases.

One example from genetics is the multi-institutional, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled investigation of the value of penicillin prophylaxis
in patients with sickle cell disease.[21](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR21)
Accumulation of a significant number of patients with sickle cell disease from
a number of centers in a carefully controlled, protocol-driven study permitted
the very clear conclusion to be drawn that penicillin did benefit patients
with sickle cell disease. In fact, the statistical power of the study was so
strong that the study was terminated earlier than anticipated when the data
indicated that the patients on placebo were at risk for sepsis and death far
in excess of those on penicillin prophylaxis. The consequence of this well-
controlled study was the conclusion by a National Institutes of Health
Consensus Development Conference that all neonates should be screened for
sickle cell disease in order to identify those with this disorder and initiate
penicillin prophylaxis to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with
clinical presentation in the absence of a diagnosis.[22](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR22)

Perhaps the most successful example of a multi-institutional, protocol-driven
clinical collaboration is the Children's Oncology Group (COG). It is estimated
that at least 85% of children with cancer are enrolled in COG protocols, and
if those involved with natural history studies are included, the enrollment
may be as high as 95%. The involvement of such a high proportion of children
with cancer in clinical trials by COG and its predecessors permits an
iterative approach to improvements in interventions and has been credited with
the remarkable success that has been achieved in pediatric cancer outcomes.

The highly individualistic approach that characterizes much of American
medicine, including medical genetics, provides the practitioner with
management autonomy. If we argue that pooling of patients into collaborative,
protocol-driven clinical studies will facilitate progress, then the conclusion
would be that the lack of collaboration by autonomous physicians delays
progress unnecessarily. To be successful, an organized national approach to
develop collaborative studies in medical genetics will require “buy-in” by the
clinical genetics community (with associated loss of practitioner autonomy)
and adequate resources to support the protocols (including patient enrollment
and support, data analyses, and iterative interventional changes).

### Summary and conclusions

The need for translational research has received considerable recent
attention. Medical geneticists and the ACMG have the opportunity to establish
a model for translational studies for the medical community through
collaborative natural history studies and interventional clinical trials.
Medical genetics will become the clinical embodiment of the Human Genome
Project if we are successful in transliterating genomic sequences and concepts
into the language of medicine. Optimal care for our patients and those of our
colleagues in other specialties of medicine will require that medical
geneticists continue to accept the responsibility for translational genomics.

## Abstract

The genomic revolution has fundamentally changed our perception of breast
cancer. It is now apparent from DNA-based massively parallel sequencing data
that at the genomic level, every breast cancer is unique and shaped by the
mutational processes to which it was exposed during its lifetime. More than 90
breast cancer driver genes have been identified as recurrently mutated, and
many occur at low frequency across the breast cancer population. Certain
cancer genes are associated with traditionally defined histologic subtypes,
but genomic intertumoral heterogeneity exists even between cancers that appear
the same under the microscope. Most breast cancers contain subclonal
populations, many of which harbor driver alterations, and subclonal structure
is typically remodeled over time, across metastasis and as a consequence of
treatment interventions. Genomics is deepening our understanding of breast
cancer biology, contributing to an accelerated phase of targeted drug
development and providing insights into resistance mechanisms. Genomics is
also providing tools necessary to deliver personalized cancer medicine, but a
number of challenges must still be addressed. _Clin Cancer Res; 23(11);

## Introduction

Technical and analytic developments underpin major advances in our
understanding of breast cancer biology over the last two decades. The
application of gene expression arrays in the early 2000s led to a refined
molecular classification, the development of prognostic assays, and a better
characterization of the contribution of the tumor microenvironment (1, 2).
First steps toward translating molecularly defined breast cancer subsets came
from efforts using gene expression–based signatures, which have led to
multiple commercially available and clinically useful assays in hormone
receptor–positive breast cancer, and are continuing to be developed for
multiple clinical/translational applications today. Discussing RNA-based
assays is beyond the scope of the current review but was the topic of a recent
_CCR 20th Anniversary Commentary_ (2). The genomic revolution later saw the
emergence of commercially available massively parallel sequencing approaches
that permit the comprehensive profiling of an entire cancer's genome, all
coding genes (exome), or a selection of genes (targeted sequencing). DNA
sequencing technologies offer the potential to deliver personalized medicine
by matching appropriate targeted therapeutics with unique molecular
aberrations within an individual's cancer. Furthermore, massively parallel
sequencing can be used to identify biomarkers associated with response to
experimental targeted therapies, both in clinical trials and _in vitro_.

Here we consider five practical applications of the genomic revolution,
summarizing in each case what we have learned thus far and considering the
challenges that remain for future endeavors (Fig. 1). Key messages include the
following: (i) the driver landscape of breast cancer includes many rare cancer
genes and an unexpected level of inter- and intratumoral driver mutation
heterogeneity; (ii) understanding the mutational processes operating
throughout a cancer's lifetime may identify therapeutic vulnerabilities; (iii)
many genomic features align with traditional molecular and histologic subtypes
that can aid classification; (iv) cancers demonstrate subclonal
diversification that may underlie primary and acquired treatment resistance;
and (v) a range of patterns of metastatic dissemination are observed
reflecting clonal evolution.

## Application 1: Characterizing the Driver Landscape of Breast Cancer

To date, almost 100 high-probability breast cancer driver genes have been
identified through the application of computational approaches to massively
parallel sequence data generated from more than 4,000 primary breast cancer
samples (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 3–18). Cancer genes have been
identified based upon somatic mutation recurrence rates that exceed
expectation after taking into account features such as background mutation
rate and spectrum, nucleotide context, enrichment in phosphorylation-specific
regions or tertiary protein structures, and the ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous mutations (19–24). Various alternative methodologies exist such as
those that adopt subnetwork analyses to identify groups of potential cancer
genes by incorporating pathway or gene interaction information, and these may
be particularly useful for identifying very rare driver genes (25–28).

Saturation analyses predict that based on the number of samples now sequenced,
most cancer genes implicated in 2% or more breast cancers will have been
identified (29). However, we expect that many more low-frequency cancer genes
remain to be discovered, because there is emerging evidence, as discussed
below, that metastatic, pretreated, male, and special histopathologic subtypes
of cancers are genomically distinct from the “general” breast cancer
population (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Table S1; refs. 6, 10–18, 30–37).
Rare “populations” are often the most clinically challenging to treat, and
further focused driver discovery exercises in these groups are warranted.

Table 2.

Key genomic findings in rare histologic subtypes (massively parallel
sequencing)

Driver alterations refer to events that are predicted to inactivate tumor
suppressor genes or activate oncogenes—common mechanisms in the former include
homozygous deletions, truncating point mutations, or disrupting rearrangements
and in the latter, focal amplifications and activating missense mutations,
typically within mutational hotspots. A recent genome-wide analysis of 560
breast cancers (9) reported that the average cancer contains three such driver
alterations (range = 0–14) and, consistent with other series, confirmed that
only a handful of cancer genes are mutated in more than 10% of breast cancers
(3–10). The most frequently implicated cancer genes (and their frequencies)
across the 560 breast cancers are _TP53_ (41%), _PIK3CA_ (30%), _MYC_ (20%),
_PTEN_ (16%), _CCND1_ (16%), _ERBB2_ (13%), _FGFR1_ (11%), and _GATA3_ (10%;
ref. 9). Because most cancer genes are mutated in less than 5% of cancers,
considerable interpatient heterogeneity exists (4, 7). By example, whole-exome
sequencing of 100 breast cancers identified driver point mutations and copy
number changes in 40 genes in 73 combinations, indicating that at the driver
gene level, most primary breast cancers are distinct (4). The wide range of
possible driver combinations within an individual cancer will demand
systematic approaches to facilitate target prioritization and guide
combination therapy approaches if we reach a position where a large number of
effective therapeutic targets are available.

The majority of driver events detected in a primary tumor are clonal, being
present in all tumor cells. However, subclones are common, and these can
harbor driver events that alter some of the most common and most frequently
clonal breast cancer genes including _TP53, MYC, PIK3CA_, and _HER2_, in
addition to rarer cancer genes such as _FGFR2_ and _RUNX1_ (3, 35, 36, 38,
39). In a multiregion sampling study, we identified subclonal, potentially
targetable alterations in 13 of 50 primary breast cancers and demonstrated
that subclones can be spatially separated, posing a challenge to
representative sampling (36). In a quarter of these cases, we identified
parallel evolution, with the same cancer gene mutated multiple times in
different subclones in the same tumor, indicating that particular subclonal
aberrations within an individual cancer may be under strong selection (36).
Highlighting the clinical relevance of such a finding, in one case of
metastatic breast cancer, parallel genetic loss of _PTEN_ in multiple
metastatic sites was documented after treatment with the PI(3)Kα inhibitor
BYL719 (40). In this case, the emergence of a convergent PTEN-null
treatment–resistant phenotype provided strong rationale for targeting the
subclonal alterations; however, in general, it is not yet clear when and if we
should target subclonal alterations or if a greater benefit will be derived
from targeting clonal alterations that are present in every cancer cell.

## Challenges

Determining the range of driver events operating within an individual breast
cancer depends, to some extent, on the sequencing technology employed (Fig.
2). Targeted approaches can provide (at lower cost than whole-genome
sequencing) high-depth sequence coverage, high sensitivity, and accurate
quantification of point mutations, overcoming, to some extent, technical
challenges such as low tumor cellularity and driver mutation subclonality
(ref. 41; Fig. 2). However, targeted approaches make prior assumptions about
the range of relevant cancer genes. Furthermore, breast cancers are
characterized by frequent and often complex structural variation, and the
precise nature of structural variation can only be captured using genome-wide
sequencing (Fig. 2; ref. 42). For example, a recent study revealed that
rearrangement breakpoints disrupt tumor suppressor gene footprints more
frequently than expected, contributing to the recessive cancer gene landscape,
with the most frequently affected genes being _PTEN, RB1_, and _ARID1B_ in 7%,
5%, and 4% of the cases, respectively (9). The same study revealed that
recurrent fusion genes and noncoding driver mutations are uncommon in primary
breast cancers (9). The full contribution of structural variation to the
driver landscape of breast cancers remains to be determined. Selecting the
most appropriate technology for incorporation in clinico-genomic trials is of
paramount importance.

Insights into breast cancer genomes by applying different massively parallel
sequencing (MPS) approaches. Comparison of whole-genome sequencing (WGS),
whole-exome sequencing (WES), and targeted sequencing (TS) as approaches for
exploring the breast cancer genome. Two typical but contrasting examples of
breast cancer genomes are presented. WGS reveals all genomic mutations types
as presented within the two Circos plots. Colored dots in the outer ring
represent base substitutions (Subs), copy number changes are reported in the
second ring, whereas the colored lines in the center represent structural
variant (SV), otherwise known as rearrangements. WES and TS identify only a
fraction of mutations and do not necessarily reflect the stark differences
between the two genomic landscapes pictured. The large numbers of mutations
identified by WGS permit mutation signature detection. WES identifies
typically 10 to 300 mutations, and signature analysis is unreliable at the
lower end of this range. Notably, the homologous recombination deficiency
(HRD) substitution signature is relatively subtle, and confident detection
usually demands several hundred mutations. Although not represented in this
figure, the high depth afforded by TS offers the additional advantage of
exploring subclonality by comparing different mutations' variant allele
fractions within a tumor, providing accurate copy number can be determined.
Note the reported numbers are estimates only for illustration purposes. NA,
not available.

Defining the targetable landscape of breast cancer remains in its infancy.
High-throughput functional validation approaches are indicated to determine
the significance of potential cancer genes and driver mutations (43, 44).
Importantly, the clinical viability of even some of the most common cancer
genes (present in more than 10% of cancers) as therapeutic targets remains as
yet unproven, with only _ERBB2_ and _PIK3CA_ (45) associated with objective
responses to targeted therapies and only the former demonstrating validated
and independent prognostic and predictive value (46). _TP53, GATA3_, and _MYC_
have diverse transcriptional activities, and attempts to target them both
directly and indirectly have proved difficult for various reasons, including
lack of specificity and efficiency (47–51). These targets remain an intense
area of research. For example, clinical trials assessing the activity of PIM
kinase inhibitors in _MYC_-amplified triple-negative breast cancers are now
keenly awaited following promising preclinical work that identified a
targetable synthetic lethal interaction between _PIM1_ and _MYC_ (52).

It is important to consider that the presence of an apparent target does not
necessarily predict for response. Recent phase III studies confirmed a
survival advantage associated with the use of mTOR inhibitors (53) and CDK4/6
inhibitors (54) in advanced estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancers;
however, to date, biomarkers to predict response to these agents have not been
identified. In the PALOMA 1 trial, _CCND1_ amplifications or loss of p16
failed to predict for a response to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (55). In
a retrospective analysis of the BOLERO-2 trial, progression-free survival
benefit was observed in association with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus
irrespective of the presence or absence of genomic alterations within _PIK3CA,
CCND1_, and _FGFR1_ (56). However, the extent of benefit from everolimus
varied according to the exon specific mutation (exon 20 versus exon 9),
indicating that the definition of a target may be more nuanced than initially
appreciated.

Overcoming the significant challenges of defining and ultimately targeting the
driver landscape of breast cancer will demand large-scale, international,
novel clinico-genomic screening and clinical trial strategies, as has been
discussed comprehensively elsewhere (57). It is also clear that, since many
driver alterations are ultarare in breast cancer, studies from single cases or
small case series will also be extremely valuable, particularly for exploring
extreme response or therapeutic resistance (58).

## Application 2: Dynamic Mutational Processes and Repair Deficiencies

Whole-genome sequencing identifies thousands of mutations within each cancer,
and although the majority of them are passenger events, the patterns that they
form, termed “mutational signatures,” can reveal the mutational processes that
shaped that cancer's evolution (59). A recent analysis of 560 breast cancer
whole genomes identified 20 distinct mutational signatures (9). Typically,
multiple mutational processes are identified within each individual breast
cancer, and their relative contributions may vary over time (36, 60).

## Challenges

A comprehensive overview of mutational processes in breast cancer is presented
in another article in this _CCR Focus_ section (61). In the context of
“practical applications,” the fundamental principle is that understanding the
processes that generate mutational diversity, the substrate of natural
selection, could ultimately result in strategies to oppose cancer development
and progression (62). However, for most mutational signatures, both etiology
and direct clinical utility are at this time unclear. At present, the mutation
signatures with the greatest potential clinical benefit are those that
identify deficiencies in the homologous recombination repair pathway and may
predict for sensitivity to platinum salt chemotherapies and PARP inhibitors
(63–68). Such signatures could extend the number of patients for whom such
agents may confer benefit, beyond those with germline or somatic mutations or
promoter methylation within _BRCA1/2_ and other _BRCA_-related genes (9, 69,
70), and has been used to confirm that an ER-positive tumor arising in a
_BRCA1_ carrier is related to the germline lesion rather than being a sporadic
cancer (71).

## Application 3: Supporting Molecular and Histologic Classification of Breast
Cancers

Despite considerable intertumoral heterogeneity, certain genomic patterns
align with the molecular and histologic subtypes. For example, luminal-like
/ER-positive breast cancers typically harbor mutations in _PIK3CA, GATA3_, or
_MAP3K1_ (6–8). The most commonly mutated cancer gene in basal-like/triple-
negative breast cancers is _TP53_, and this usually contains truncating
(frameshift or nonsense) mutations (72). In contrast, when _TP53_ mutations
occur in luminal-like cancers, they are usually missense mutations (8, 10,
73). Characteristic genomic changes also underlie histologic subtypes.
Recently, several consortia have genomically characterized more than 1,225
invasive lobular breast cancers (6, 10, 13, 17, 18). Lobular tumors typically
express ER and lack _HER2_ amplification, and represent the second most
frequent histologic subtype, accounting for up to 15% of all invasive breast
carcinomas (74). Lobular tumors display a distinct mutational pattern compared
with their ER-positive/HER2-negative ductal counterparts, including a higher
frequency of _CDH1_ and _PTEN_ loss and _AKT1, ERBB2, ERBB3_, and _TBX3_
mutations (6, 10, 13, 17). Furthermore, ER-positive tumors of lobular and
ductal type have a strong tendency toward _FOXA1_ or _GATA3_ mutations,
respectively, indicating that distinct genomic mechanisms of ER activation may
exist in these distinct pathologies (6, 17, 75). Distinct genomic patterns are
also characteristic of rare tumor types, including adenoid cystic, apocrine,
medullary, mucinous, metaplastic, micropapillary, and neuroendocrine tumors,
and are detailed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 (10–12, 15, 16, 18, 32,
33, 76).

## Challenges

We continue to extrapolate from global breast cancer populations to make
clinical treatment decisions for special histologic subtypes. Now, there is
growing evidence of molecular differences between these subtypes. We should,
therefore, acknowledge both molecular and histologic subtypes as relevant
pathologic covariates in future clinical and translational research. In
addition, because certain potential therapeutic targets are enriched in some
subtypes, such as _ERBB2_ and _ERBB3_ mutations in lobular carcinomas, one
could imagine that conventional pathology could be used to enhance mutational
screening for clinical trial enrollment.

## Application 4: Defining the Genomic Basis of Metastasis

Clinically overt metastasis to distant organs is currently incurable. The most
informative sequencing approaches exploring this fatal transition compare
primary tumor and metastatic deposits from the same individual (Supplementary
Table S1). Studies focused on coding mutations reveal that most of the driver
events within the primary tumor are shared with associated metastatic deposits
(77–80). This indicates that the primary tumor may be a good surrogate for the
relapse-seeding clone, which is the target for adjuvant therapies that have
the potential to improve cancer cure rates (79, 80). For example, in a study
of single metastatic deposits from 33 individuals, 87% of driver mutations and
86% of copy number aberrations were also detected in the primary tumor (79). A
recent single-cell sequencing study of disseminated tumor cells supported this
linear model of late dissemination from the primary tumor (81). Metastatic
deposits generally harbor additional private mutations, often including known
driver mutations, reflecting ongoing subclonal diversification after
dissemination (36, 77–80, 82).

A handful of published studies have started to unravel the genomic basis of
breast cancer progression and define the temporal ordering of mutations
through the analysis of the primary tumor and multiple metastatic deposits
acquired during “rapid” autopsy (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 40, 77–80,
82–84). In this context, a recent survey conducted in Australia to evaluate
patients' attitudes toward rapid autopsy and tissue donation revealed that 87%
were willing to donate tissue at death (85). So far, multiple tumor deposits
from a total of 17 breast cancer patients who underwent autopsy have been
investigated at the mutational and copy number level (40, 80, 83, 84).
Although each patient reported in these studies has her own history of
treatment and disease evolution, several messages emerge. First, given the
observed primary/metastasis and intermetastasis genomic heterogeneity, there
is no single tumor sample that recapitulates the complete disease, that is,
all the genomic alterations present in all samples from the patient (40, 80,
82–84). Second, both linear and parallel evolution from the primary tumor are
observed (Fig. 1; refs. 80, 83, 84). In some patients, there is only one
successful seeding event that gives rise to a so-called metastatic precursor
that then seeds the other metastases, possibly in a cascading manner (Fig. 1).
In other patients, multiple successful seeding events arise from the primary
tumor. Finally, evidence is accumulating that metastatic cross-seeding occurs
between established metastases (83, 84).

## Challenges

A potential limitation of the studies that investigate metastasis using a
targeted sequencing approach is that the cancer genes present in these panels
were derived almost exclusively from the study of treatment-naïve primary
tumors and, consequently, may fail to identify genes enriched or specific to
metastatic, relapsed, or pretreated cancers. Some preliminary evidence from
metastatic tumors suggests indeed that different drivers may be associated
with metastasis, and that these are drawn from an even wider range of cancer
genes than in primary tumors (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 30, 34, 79, 86).
It is conceivable that some genes only act as drivers in nuanced situations,
for example, in resisting a specific anticancer therapy, and in specific
cancer subtypes, so studies should be powered to identify rare resistance
mutations, a theme that will be explored in further detail later in this
review (34, 87–89).

Extensive work remains within this field to determine when and what driver
mutations are most relevant to the application of personalized medicine.
Exhaustive sampling of all metastatic deposits is not practical, so if
metastasis-specific mutations are clinically important, representative
sampling strategies need to be developed. Options include sampling areas of
progressive disease after treatment interventions, particularly when a mixed
response is seen, or alternatively, using “liquid biopsies” (refs. 90–92;
Supplementary Table S1). In one study, sequencing of circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) successfully identified changes in the levels of subclonal mutations
as the relevant metastatic sites responded or progressed, providing proof of
principle for the role of a liquid biopsy to monitor treatment response (90).
Such an approach can also use ctDNA to predict minimal residual disease and
relapse, potentially extending the window of opportunity for applying adjuvant
therapies to further improve cancer cure rates (93).

## Application 5: Identifying Genomic Mechanisms of Resistance to Treatment

Changes in subclonal structure have been demonstrated across treatment
interventions using cytotoxic and endocrine therapy and targeted therapies
(35–37, 40, 94). Several genomic mechanisms of resistance to various therapies
have recently been uncovered, with mutations in _ESR1_, the gene encoding the
ER, being the most described and studied in the context of endocrine
resistance (34, 87, 95–98). Mutations cluster in the ligand-binding domain of
_ESR1_ and activate ER in the absence of the estrogen ligand. These mutations
have been detected almost exclusively in the context of prior endocrine
therapy, typically with aromatase inhibitors, and more frequently where
sensitivity to prior endocrine therapy was observed (98), suggesting that
these mutations are associated with acquired, but not primary, endocrine
resistance. A recent large-scale initiative, the Metastatic Breast Cancer
Project, characterized over 140 metastatic biopsies from endocrine
therapy–treated patients and identified several acquired mutations, in
addition to _ESR1_, that may be involved in endocrine resistance, including
_AKT1, ERBB2, KRAS_, and _RB1_ alterations (99). There is also preliminary
evidence from cell-line and patient-derived xenograft models that
CDK4/6-inhibitor resistance may be mediated by loss of _RB1_ or amplification
of _CCNE1_ or _CDK6_ (100, 101).

Treatment resistance might be complicated by heterogeneity, for example,
multiple metastatic deposits from an individual may exhibit parallel evolution
of genomic resistance, whereas other metastases may not have any genomic mark
of resistance, potentially explaining the heterogeneous response to treatment
observed in the clinic (40, 83, 96–98, 102).

## Challenges

Interrogating ctDNA represents an attractive option for identifying multiple
mechanisms of resistance in different metastases. This is the strategy adopted
by the recent UK plasmaMATCH trial ([ISRCTN16945804](/external-
ref?link_type=ISRCTN&access_num=ISRCTN16945804)), a primary aim of which is to
determine whether plasma-derived ctDNA is an acceptable alternative to tumor
biopsies for mutation identification in metastatic breast cancer. A secondary
aim is to determine whether there is a clinical benefit from therapeutic
targeting of mutations identified in ctDNA. However, open questions remain
regarding the contribution of tumor deposits to ctDNA. This contribution could
be dependent on the metastatic organ, cancer proliferation rate, histology,
size of the metastasis, and response to therapy. For instance, it has been
demonstrated that brain metastases do not or poorly contribute to ctDNA in
plasma and that ctDNA from cerebrospinal fluid would offer a better
representation of the genomic alterations of brain metastases (103).

It is also important to perform comprehensive assessment of the various
pathways activated within an individual cancer rather than seeking a single
mutation in isolation (104). For example, only a fraction of patients
receiving selective PI3Kα inhibitors respond, and nonresponders tend to
demonstrate an increase in ER-dependent transcription that can be overcome in
some cases by combining the PI3Kα inhibitor with an anti-estrogen such as
tamoxifen or fulvestrant (105).

## Conclusions and Perspective

Although the genomic revolution has profoundly broadened our understanding of
the number and nature of somatic alterations within breast cancer genomes, the
clinical benefit of these discoveries remains modest. The feasibility of DNA
sequencing to direct the management of metastatic breast cancer through a
personalized cancer medicine approach has been examined in two prospective
molecular screening studies: SAFIR01/UNICANCER and MOSCATO, in the years 2011
to 2012 (106, 107). The two studies included 423 and 129 patients, and
identified potentially targetable alterations in 40% and 46% of patients with
the ability to personalize therapy in 13% and 23% of cases, respectively. Of
the patients who received targeted therapy, 9% and 20% had a partial response
and 21% and 56% had stable disease, respectively. Therefore, 3% and 15% of
patients originally screened in these two studies derived clinical benefit
from a targeted therapy, but in the absence of a control arm, we cannot infer
if the benefit exceeded that of standard of care. It is worth noting that the
SHIVA trial, which randomized 293 patients with potentially targetable
alterations to molecularly targeted versus standard therapy and found no
improvement in outcome but higher toxicity, involved last-generation targeted
agents (108). The effect of a personalized cancer medicine approach on
survival or, indeed, any other outcome remains to be determined within
randomized trials using validated biomarkers and modern targeted drugs.

Although this review has focused on genomic sequence data, it is clear that
tackling breast cancer, a complex set of diseases, will require integrated
assessment of a wide range of data types, including pathologic
characterization (such as histologic subtyping and assessment of the cellular
composition), transcriptomics, epigenetics, and proteomics, in addition to
genomics (6, 10, 109).

Most large driver discovery studies published to date include primary,
treatment-naïve cancers (Supplementary Table S1), and around 80% of these are
likely to have been cured using existing treatment strategies. Moving forward,
focus should be placed on understanding the mechanisms of both primary and
acquired treatment resistance and the genomics of metastasis that is almost
universally fatal. This should include using genomics to identify primary
breast cancers most at risk of relapse and to characterize disseminated tumor
cells that are capable of metastasis formation.

We believe that these goals can be achieved through the joint results from
many large-scale, prospective initiatives that aim to better characterize
metastases and link molecular findings with meticulously annotated clinical
and treatment information. These initiatives include the AURORA program, the
Metastatic Breast Cancer Project (<https://www.mbcproject.org/users/new>), the
UK plasmaMATCH ([ISRCTN16945804](/external-
ref?link_type=ISRCTN&access_num=ISRCTN16945804)), as well as the various rapid
autopsy programs (99, 110, 111). However, given the extensive intertumoral
heterogeneity of breast cancer, we must not dismiss the power of “n _of 1_”
studies and small case series that could deliver key insights into ultrarare
alterations and associated treatment resistance and response.

A large amount of genomic data from several thousand breast cancers has
already been generated, and further value can almost certainly be extracted
from this. For example, a combined analysis, although challenging on account
of the heterogeneity of the datasets, would have much higher power to detect
rare mutations than any individual study to date. Supporting such a
collaborative approach is the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia
Information Exchange (GENIE; <http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Pages
/aacr-project-genie.aspx#.WH6TMnCFNOC>), an international data-sharing project
that aims to collate genomic and clinical data from tens of thousands of
patients in multiple institutions.

Great enthusiasm accompanied the initial years of the genomic revolution as a
flood of novel insights into the breast cancer genome were presented in quick
succession. We now have a clearer idea not only of the potential clinical
applications of genomics but also of the scale and nature of the challenges
that must be surmounted to bring maximum benefit to breast cancer patients. It
is clear that delivering personalized breast cancer treatments to all patients
in the future will only be possible if we focus on collaborative and
integrative approaches now.

# Genetics vs. Genomics Fact Sheet

Genetics and genomics both play roles in health and disease. Genetics refers
to the study of genes and the way that certain traits or conditions are passed
down from one generation to another. Genomics describes the study of all of a
person's genes (the genome).

## What are genetics and genomics?

Genetics is a term that refers to the study of genes and their roles in
inheritance - in other words, the way that certain traits or conditions are
passed down from one generation to another. Genetics involves scientific
studies of genes and their effects. Genes (units of heredity) carry the
instructions for making proteins, which direct the activities of cells and
functions of the body. Examples of genetic or inherited disorders include
cystic fibrosis (See: [Learning About Cystic
Fibrosis](https://www.genome.gov/10001213/learning-about-cystic-fibrosis/)),
Huntington's disease ([Learning About Huntington's
Disease](https://www.genome.gov/10001215/learning-about-huntingtons-
disease/)), and phenylketonuria (PKU) ([Learning About
Phenylketonuria](https://www.genome.gov/25020037/learning-about-
phenylketonuria/)).

Genomics is a more recent term that describes the study of all of a person's
genes (the genome), including interactions of those genes with each other and
with the person's environment. Genomics includes the scientific study of
complex diseases such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer because
these diseases are typically caused more by a combination of genetic and
environmental factors than by individual genes. Genomics is offering new
possibilities for therapies and treatments for some complex diseases, as well
as new diagnostic methods.

## Why are genetics and genomics important to my health?

Genetics and genomics both play roles in health and disease. Genetics helps
individuals and families learn about how conditions such as sickle cell anemia
and cystic fibrosis are inherited in families, what screening and testing
options are available, and, for some genetic conditions, what treatments are
available. (See: [Frequently Asked Questions About Genetic
Disorders](https://www.genome.gov/19016930/faq-about-genetic-disorders/))

Genomics is helping researchers discover why some people get sick from certain
infections, environmental factors, and behaviors, while others do not. For
example, there are some people who exercise their whole lives, eat a healthy
diet, have regular medical checkups, and die of a heart attack at age 40.
There are also people who smoke, never exercise, eat unhealthy foods and live
to be 100. Genomics may hold the key to understanding these differences.

Apart from accidents (such as falls, motor vehicle accidents or poisoning),
genomic factors play a role in nine of the ten leading causes of death in the
United States (for example, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. See: [Leading
Causes of Death](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/FASTATS/lcod.htm) [cdc.gov]). All
human beings are 99.9 percent identical in their genetic makeup. Differences
in the remaining 0.1 percent hold important clues about the causes of
diseases. Gaining a better understanding of the interactions between genes and
the environment by means of genomics is helping researchers find better ways
to improve health and prevent disease, such as modifying diet and exercise
plans to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people who carry
genetic predispositions to developing this disease.

## Why are genetics and genomics important to my family's health?

Understanding more about diseases caused by a single gene (using genetics) and
complex diseases caused by multiple genes and environmental factors (using
genomics) can lead to earlier diagnoses, interventions, and targeted
treatments. A person's health is influenced by his/her family history and
shared environmental factors. This makes family history an important,
personalized tool that can help identify many of the causative factors for
conditions that also have a genetic component. The family history can serve as
the cornerstone for learning about genetic and genomic conditions in a family,
and for developing individualized approaches to disease prevention,
intervention, and treatment. (See: [My Family Health
Portrait](https://www.genome.gov/17516481/the-us-surgeon-generals-family-
history-initiative-family-history-initiative/)).

## What are some of the new genetic and genomic techniques and technologies?

**Proteomics**

The suffix "-ome" comes from the Greek for _all_, _every_, or _complete_. It
was originally used in "genome," which refers to all the genes in a person or
other organism. Due to the success of large-scale biology projects such as the
sequencing of the human genome, the suffix "-ome" is now being used in other
research contexts. Proteomics is an example. The DNA sequence of genes carries
the instructions, or code, for building proteins. This DNA is transcribed into
a related molecule, RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Proteomics,
therefore, is a similar large-scale analysis of all the proteins in an
organism, tissue type, or cell (called the proteome). Proteomics can be used
to reveal specific, abnormal proteins that lead to diseases, such as certain
forms of cancer.

**Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics**

The terms "pharmacogenetics" and "pharmacogenomics" are often used
interchangeably in describing the intersection of pharmacology (the study of
drugs, or pharmaceuticals) and genetic variability in determining an
individual's response to particular drugs. The terms may be distinguished in
the following way.

Pharmacogenetics is the field of study dealing with the variability of
responses to medications due to variation in single genes. Pharmacogenetics
takes into account a person's genetic information regarding specific drug
receptors and how drugs are transported and metabolized by the body. The goal
of pharmacogenetics is to create an individualized drug therapy that allows
for the best choice and dose of drugs. One example is the breast cancer drug
trastuzumab (Herceptin). This therapy works only for women whose tumors have a
particular genetic profile that leads to overproduction of a protein called
HER2. (See: [Genetics, Disease Prevention and
Treatment](https://www.genome.gov/19016938/faq-about-genetics-disease-
prevention-and-treatment/))

Pharmacogenomics is similar to pharmacogenetics, except that it typically
involves the search for variations in multiple genes that are associated with
variability in drug response. Since pharmacogenomics is one of the large-scale
"omic" technologies, it can examine the entirety of the genome, rather than
just single genes. Pharmacogenomic studies may also examine genetic variation
among large groups of people (populations), for example, in order to see how
different drugs might affect different racial or ethnic groups.

Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies are leading to drugs that can be
tailor-made for individuals, and adapted to each person's particular genetic
makeup. Although a person's environment, diet, age, lifestyle, and state of
health can also influence that person's response to medicines, understanding
an individual's genetic makeup is key to creating personalized drugs that work
better and have fewer side effects than the one-size-fits-all drugs that are
common today. (See: [Genetics, Disease Prevention and
Treatment](https://www.genome.gov/19016938/faq-about-genetics-disease-
prevention-and-treatment/)). For example, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) recommends genetic testing before giving the chemotherapy
drug mercaptopurine (Purinethol) to patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia. Some people have a genetic variant that interferes with their
ability to process this drug. This processing problem can cause severe side
effects, unless the standard dose is adjusted according to the patient's
genetic makeup. (See: [Frequently Asked Questions about
Pharmacogenomics](https://www.genome.gov/27530645/faq-about-
pharmacogenomics/)).

**Stem Cell Therapy**

Stem cells have two important characteristics. First, stem cells are
unspecialized cells that can develop into various specialized body cells.
Second, stem cells are able to stay in their unspecialized state and make
copies of themselves. Embryonic stem cells come from the embryo at a very
early stage in development (the blastocyst staqe). The stem cells in the
blastocyst go on to develop all of the cells in the complete organism. Adult
stem cells come from more fully developed tissues, like umbilical cord blood
in newborns, circulating blood, bone marrow or skin.

Medical researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to repair or
replace damaged body tissues, similar to whole organ transplants. Embryonic
stem cells from the blastocyst have the ability to develop into every type of
tissue (skin, liver, kidney, blood, etc.) found in an adult human. Adult stem
cells are more limited in their potential (for example, stem cells from liver
may only develop into more liver cells). In organ transplants, when tissues
from a donor are placed into the body of a patient, there is the possibility
that the patient's immune system may react and reject the donated tissue as
"foreign." However, by using stem cells, there may be less risk of this immune
rejection, and the therapy may be more successful.

Stem cells have been used in experiments to form cells of the bone marrow,
heart, blood vessels, and muscle. Since the 1990's, umbilical cord blood stem
cells have been used to treat heart and other physical problems in children
who have rare metabolic conditions, or to treat children with certain anemias
and leukemias. For example, one of the treatment options for [childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/child
ALL/Patient/page1) [cancer.gov] is stem cell transplantation therapy.

There has been much debate nationally about the use of embryonic stem cells,
especially about the creation of human embryos for use in experiments. In
1995, Congress enacted a ban on federal financing for research using human
embryos. However, these restrictions have not stopped researchers in the
United States and elsewhere from using private funding to create new embryonic
cell lines and undertaking research with them. The embryos for such research
are typically obtained from embryos that develop from eggs that have been
fertilized _in vitro_ \- as in an _in vitro_ fertilization clinic - and then
donated for research purposes with informed consent of the donors. In 2009,
some of the barriers to federal financing of responsible and scientifically
worthy human stem cell research were lifted.

**Cloning**

Cloning can refer to genes, cells, or whole organisms. In the case of a cell,
a clone refers to any genetically identical cell in a population that comes
from a single, common ancestor. For example, when a single bacterial cell
copies its DNA and divides thousands of times, all of the cells that are
formed will contain the same DNA and will be clones of the common ancestor
bacterial cell. Gene cloning involves manipulations to make multiple identical
copies of a single gene from the same ancestor gene. Cloning an organism means
making a genetically identical copy of all of the cells, tissues, and organs
that make up the organism. There are two major types of cloning that may
relate to humans or other animals: therapeutic cloning and reproductive
cloning.

Therapeutic cloning involves growing cloned cells or tissues from an
individual, such as new liver tissue for a patient with a liver disease. Such
cloning attempts typically involve the use of stem cells. The nucleus will be
taken from a patient's body cell, such as a liver cell, and inserted into an
egg that has had its nucleus removed. This will ultimately produce a
blastocyst whose stem cells could then be used to create new tissue that is
genetically identical to that of the patient.

Reproductive cloning is a related process used to generate an entire animal
that has the same nuclear DNA as another currently or previously existing
animal. The first cloned animals were frogs. Dolly, the famous sheep, is
another example of cloning. The success rates of reproductive animal cloning,
however, have been very low. In 2005, South Korean researchers claimed to have
produced human embryonic stem cell lines by cloning genetic material from
patients. However, this data was later reported to have been falsified.

**Proteomics**

The suffix "-ome" comes from the Greek for _all_, _every_, or _complete_. It
was originally used in "genome," which refers to all the genes in a person or
other organism. Due to the success of large-scale biology projects such as the
sequencing of the human genome, the suffix "-ome" is now being used in other
research contexts. Proteomics is an example. The DNA sequence of genes carries
the instructions, or code, for building proteins. This DNA is transcribed into
a related molecule, RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Proteomics,
therefore, is a similar large-scale analysis of all the proteins in an
organism, tissue type, or cell (called the proteome). Proteomics can be used
to reveal specific, abnormal proteins that lead to diseases, such as certain
forms of cancer.

# A Brief Guide to Genomics

Genomics is the study of all of a person's genes (the genome), including
interactions of those genes with each other and with the person's environment.

## What is DNA?

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the chemical compound that contains the
instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of nearly all living
organisms. DNA molecules are made of two twisting, paired strands, often
referred to as a double helix

Each DNA strand is made of four chemical units, called nucleotide bases, which
comprise the genetic "alphabet." The bases are adenine (A), thymine (T),
guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Bases on opposite strands pair specifically: an
A always pairs with a T; a C always pairs with a G. The order of the As, Ts,
Cs and Gs determines the meaning of the information encoded in that part of
the DNA molecule just as the order of letters determines the meaning of a
word.

## What is a genome?

An organism's complete set of DNA is called its genome. Virtually every single
cell in the body contains a complete copy of the approximately 3 billion DNA
base pairs, or letters, that make up the human genome.

With its four-letter language, DNA contains the information needed to build
the entire human body. A gene traditionally refers to the unit of DNA that
carries the instructions for making a specific protein or set of proteins.
Each of the estimated 20,000 to 25,000 genes in the human genome codes for an
average of three proteins.

Located on 23 pairs of chromosomes packed into the nucleus of a human cell,
genes direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and
messenger molecules. Specifically, an enzyme copies the information in a
gene's DNA into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA
travels out of the nucleus and into the cell's cytoplasm, where the mRNA is
read by a tiny molecular machine called a ribosome, and the information is
used to link together small molecules called amino acids in the right order to
form a specific protein.

Proteins make up body structures like organs and tissue, as well as control
chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. If a cell's DNA is
mutated, an abnormal protein may be produced, which can disrupt the body's
usual processes and lead to a disease such as cancer.

## What is DNA sequencing?

Sequencing simply means determining the exact order of the bases in a strand
of DNA. Because bases exist as pairs, and the identity of one of the bases in
the pair determines the other member of the pair, researchers do not have to
report both bases of the pair.

In the most common type of sequencing used today, called sequencing by
synthesis, DNA polymerase (the enzyme in cells that synthesizes DNA) is used
to generate a new strand of DNA from a strand of interest. In the sequencing
reaction, the enzyme incorporates into the new DNA strand individual
nucleotides that have been chemically tagged with a fluorescent label. As this
happens, the nucleotide is excited by a light source, and a fluorescent signal
is emitted and detected. The signal is different depending on which of the
four nucleotides was incorporated. This method can generate 'reads' of 125
nucleotides in a row and billions of reads at a time.

To assemble the sequence of all the bases in a large piece of DNA such as a
gene, researchers need to read the sequence of overlapping segments. This
allows the longer sequence to be assembled from shorter pieces, somewhat like
putting together a linear jigsaw puzzle. In this process, each base has to be
read not just once, but at least several times in the overlapping segments to
ensure accuracy.

Researchers can use DNA sequencing to search for genetic variations and/or
mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease.
The disease-causing change may be as small as the substitution, deletion, or
addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of
bases.

## What is the Human Genome Project?

The Human Genome Project, which was led at the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) by the National Human Genome Research Institute, produced a very high-
quality version of the human genome sequence that is freely available in
public databases. That international project was successfully completed in
April 2003, under budget and more than two years ahead of schedule.

The sequence is not that of one person, but is a composite derived from
several individuals. Therefore, it is a "representative" or generic sequence.
To ensure anonymity of the DNA donors, more blood samples (nearly 100) were
collected from volunteers than were used, and no names were attached to the
samples that were analyzed. Thus, not even the donors knew whether their
samples were actually used.

The Human Genome Project was designed to generate a resource that could be
used for a broad range of biomedical studies. One such use is to look for the
genetic variations that increase risk of specific diseases, such as cancer, or
to look for the type of genetic mutations frequently seen in cancerous cells.
More research can then be done to fully understand how the genome functions
and to discover the genetic basis for health and disease.

## What are the implications for medical science?

Virtually every human ailment has some basis in our genes. Until recently,
doctors were able to take the study of genes, or genetics, into consideration
only in cases of birth defects and a limited set of other diseases. These were
conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, which have very simple, predictable
inheritance patterns because each is caused by a change in a single gene.

With the vast trove of data about human DNA generated by the Human Genome
Project and other genomic research, scientists and clinicians have more
powerful tools to study the role that multiple genetic factors acting together
and with the environment play in much more complex diseases. These diseases,
such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease constitute the majority
of health problems in the United States. Genome-based research is already
enabling medical researchers to develop improved diagnostics, more effective
therapeutic strategies, evidence-based approaches for demonstrating clinical
efficacy, and better decision-making tools for patients and providers.
Ultimately, it appears inevitable that treatments will be tailored to a
patient's particular genomic makeup. Thus, the role of genetics in health care
is starting to change profoundly and the first examples of the era of genomic
medicine are upon us.

It is important to realize, however, that it often takes considerable time,
effort, and funding to move discoveries from the scientific laboratory into
the medical clinic. Most new drugs based on genome-based research are
estimated to be at least 10 to 15 years away, though recent genome-driven
efforts in lipid-lowering therapy have considerably shortened that interval.
According to biotechnology experts, it usually takes more than a decade for a
company to conduct the kinds of clinical studies needed to receive approval
from the Food and Drug Administration.

Screening and diagnostic tests, however, are here. Rapid progress is also
being made in the emerging field of pharmacogenomics, which involves using
information about a patient's genetic make-up to better tailor drug therapy to
their individual needs.

Clearly, genetics remains just one of several factors that contribute to
people's risk of developing most common diseases. Diet, lifestyle, and
environmental exposures also come into play for many conditions, including
many types of cancer. Still, a deeper understanding of genetics will shed
light on more than just hereditary risks by revealing the basic components of
cells and, ultimately, explaining how all the various elements work together
to affect the human body in both health and disease.

# Masters of Science in Translational Biotechnology



  * [Admissions Requirements](http://mgm.ufl.edu/academics/programs/masters-of-science-programs/master-of-science-in-translational-biotechnology/admission-requirements/)
  * [Masters of Science in Translational Biotechnology Handbook](http://mgm.ufl.edu/files/2014/07/Masters-of-Science-in-Translational-Biotechnology-Handbook.pdf)



The Science Master’s Program in Translational Biotechnology is a two-year
thesis program that is interdisciplinary (biosciences and business), is
research intensive, has deep industry involvement, and includes a formal
internship at a company. Students will graduate with a major (Master of
Science in Medical Sciences) and a grad Minor in Entrepreneurship limited to
GEB, ENT and FIN courses . The Masters of Science Program in Translational
Biotechnology has the support of the Provost, the Vice President for Research,
and Deans of the Colleges of Medicine and Business Administration.

The Program is focused on applied and translational research. Translational
Biotechnology includes drug/biologics/device product development,
manufacturing process development, assay development, toxicology studies,
quality systems (quality control and quality assurance), clinical trial
support, and regulatory compliance. These activities are essential for testing
new drugs/biologics/devices in humans and their subsequent commercialization.
Translational Biotechnology activities are foundational for companies, and are
increasingly gaining importance in the academic setting where new technologies
are being tested in humans prior to entering the commercial sector. Courses
incorporated into this unique Program encompass biotechnology science together
with regulatory compliance and best business practices. Graduate courses in
product development, regulatory compliance (cGMPs/GTPs/GLPs/GCPs), quality
systems (Quality control and Quality Assurance), process development,
analytical product testing, and biomanufacturing are essential topics for
creating scientists capable of sustaining translational research and
commercialization. Product development of biotechnological or biomedical
products including biopharmaceuticals; diagnostic test materials; enzymes,
antibodies, and other protein products; transgenic plants and animals; tissue
and cellular products, and biomedical implants and devices requires that
scientists have the knowledge to carefully complete procedures in compliance
with foreign and domestic regulations. Other features of the program are the
infusion of personal and professional skills (communication, documentation,
teamwork, interviewing, work ethic, etc), ethics and responsible conduct of
research, and international perspectives.

Deadline for applications is March 31 of the current year fall
admission.Applicants must meet the minimum requirements for the University of
Florida Graduate School: GPA 3.0 and a score on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE)
of 1000 Combined verbal and quantitative for the old scale, and a minimum
score of 300 for the new scale. Note that for students accepted into the
Masters the average GPA is 3.5, GRE is 310 (new) or 1220 (old). The program
requirements 3 letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose and
“official” transcripts.

#### Education and training

A foundation of the Program is a high-quality research project under the
direction of a skilled mentor, with supervision by a committee composed of
members of the University’s Graduate Research Faculty. Specialization may be
in any of the fields of research being pursued in the College of Medicine or
local biotechnology company.  During the first year of the program, students
will enroll in lecture courses and seminar course, and will begin working in a
mentor’s laboratory. The content of the lecture courses is intended to address
a need for a strong foundation in advanced level biology and chemistry that is
applied to biotechnology and biomedical product development. Courses are
available that bridge basic life sciences and applied research, and these have
been brought together with courses in business. Both the seminar series and
the lecture courses provide preparation for Master’s research which should be
well underway by the end of the second semester. The second year of graduate
study for the student is devoted to finishing the required courses and doing
research. Students may also enroll in additional courses, according to their
interests and backgrounds. Following the four semesters of coursework and
research, the students will be placed into internships companies not limited
to Flordia. Students will work together with steering committee members to
review available companies and associated projects, and a match will be made.

#### Degree Requirements:

Completion of the degree will require a total of 48 credit hours with 36
credit hours comprising biomedical coursework, laboratory research, and
internship for the major and 6 hours of business coursework for the minor.
Students will chose from several courses and course modules available at the
COM within the scope of the Program (student course choices will be reviewed
by the mentor, program coordinator, and program Director), and for the
business courses, students choose six credits from several options. These
courses are taught in seven week blocks. The courses include: financial
accounting, finance, economics, entrepreneurship, law, marketing, management,
and operations. An example of a program of study is shown in the table below,
and is not limited to the courses listed.

The biomedical and business courses are brought together to create the
curriculum in the table above. In the classroom, students will learn the
profiles of major departments/areas (marketing, sales, finance,
administration, HR, production, manufacturing support, QC/QA, research and
development, regulatory affairs, clinical affairs, etc.), the operations of
each, and how they interact with each other and outside organizations. Each
key operation will be presented in a collection of learning media (classroom,

# Translational research

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to navigation Jump to search

Effort to build on basic scientific research

Not to be confused with [Translation studies](/wiki/Translation_studies).

**Translational research** – a term often used interchangeably with **translational medicine** or **translational science** or **bench to bedside** – is an effort to build on [basic scientific research](/wiki/Basic_research) to create new [therapies](/wiki/Therapies),[1] [medical procedures](/wiki/Medical_procedure), or [diagnostics](/wiki/Diagnostic). Basic [biomedical research](/wiki/Biomedical_research) is based on studies of [disease processes](/wiki/Pathophysiology) using, for example, [cell cultures](/wiki/Cell_culture) or [animal models](/wiki/Animal_model).[2] The [adjective](/wiki/Adjective) "translational" refers to the "[translation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/translation)" (the term derives from the [Latin](/wiki/Latin) for "carrying over") of basic scientific findings in a laboratory setting into potential treatments for disease.[3][4][5][6]

## Definitions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Translational_research&action=edit&se
ction=1)]

Translational medicine is defined by the European Society for Translational
Medicine (EUSTM) as "an interdisciplinary branch of the biomedical field
supported by three main pillars: benchside, bedside and community."[2]

It is defined for school-based education by the Education Futures
Collaboration (www.meshguides.org) as research which translates concepts to
classroom practice.[7] Examples of translational research are commonly found
in education subject association journals and in the MESHGuides which have
been designed for this purpose.[8]

Translational research applies findings from basic science to enhance human
health and well-being. Translational research adopts a scientific
investigation/ enquiry into a given problem facing medical/health practices to
surmount such problem which will helps to raise aggregate health
performance.[9] In a medical research context, it aims to "translate" findings
in fundamental research into medical practice and meaningful health outcomes.
Translational research implements a "bench-to-bedside", from laboratory
experiments through clinical trials to point-of-care patient applications,[10]
model, harnessing knowledge from basic sciences to produce new drugs, devices,
and treatment options for patients. The end point of translational research is
the production of a promising new treatment that can be used with practical
applications, that can then be used clinically or are able to be
commercialized.[3]

As a relatively new research discipline, translational research incorporates
aspects of both basic science and clinical research, requiring skills and
resources that are not readily available in a basic laboratory or clinical
setting. Translational research is conceived due to the elongated time often
taken to bring to bear discovered medical idea in practical terms in a health
system.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_] It is for these
reasons that translational research is more effective in dedicated university
science departments or isolated, dedicated research centers.[11] Since 2009,
the field has had specialized journals, the _[American Journal of
Translational Research](/wiki/American_Journal_of_Translational_Research)_ and
_[Translational Research](/wiki/Translational_Research_\(journal\))_ dedicated
to translational research and its findings.

Translational research is broken down into different stages, including two-
stage (T1 and T2), four-stage (T1, T2, T3, and T4), and five-stage (T1, T2,
T3, T4, and T5) schemes. In a two-stage model, _T1 research_, refers to the
"bench-to-bedside" enterprise of translating knowledge from the basic sciences
into the development of new treatments and _T2 research_ refers to translating
the findings from clinical trials into everyday practice.[3] In a five-stage
scheme, T1 involves basic research, T2 involves pre-clinical research, T3
involves clinical research, T4 involves clinical implementation, and T5
involves implementation in the public health sphere. Waldman et al. propose a
scheme going from T0 to T5. T0 is laboratory (before human) research. In
T1-translation, new laboratory discoveries are first translated to human
application, which includes phase I & II clinical trials. In T2-translation,
candidate health applications progress through clinical development to
engender the evidence base for integration into clinical practice guidelines.
This includes phase III clinical trials. In T3-translation, dissemination into
community practices happens. T4-translation seeks to (1) advance scientific
knowledge to paradigms of disease prevention, and (2) move health practices
established in T3 into population health impact. Finally, T5-translation
focuses on improving the wellness of populations by reforming suboptimal
social structures.[12]

In a two-stage scheme, translational research includes two areas of
translation. One is the process of applying discoveries generated during
research in the laboratory, and in preclinical studies, to the development of
trials and studies in humans. The second area of translation concerns research
aimed at enhancing the adoption of best practices in the community. Cost-
effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies is also an important part
of translational science.[3]

## Comparison to basic research or applied research[[edit](/w/index.php?title=
Translational_research&action=edit&section=2)]

[Basic research](/wiki/Basic_research) is the systematic study directed toward
greater [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge) or understanding of the fundamental
aspects of [phenomena](/wiki/Phenomena) and is performed without thought of
practical ends. It results in general knowledge and understanding of nature
and its laws.[13]

Applied research is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical
application of [science](/wiki/Science). It accesses and uses the research
communities' accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a
specific, often state, [business](/wiki/Commerce), or [client-
driven](/wiki/Customer) purpose.[14]

In medicine, translational research is increasingly a separate research field.
A citation pattern between the applied and basic sides in cancer research
appeared around 2000.[15]

## Challenges and criticisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Translational_research&
action=edit&section=3)]

Critics of translational research (to the exclusion of more basic research)
point to examples of important drugs that arose from fortuitous discoveries in
the course of basic research such as [penicillin](/wiki/Penicillin) and
[benzodiazepines](/wiki/Benzodiazepines),[16] and the importance of basic
research in improving our understanding of basic biological facts (e.g. the
function and structure of [DNA](/wiki/DNA)) that go on to transform applied
medical research.[17]

Examples of failed translational research in the pharmaceutical industry
include the failure of anti-aβ therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease.[18] Other
problems have stemmed from the widespread irreproducibility thought to exist
in translational research literature.[19]

## Facilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Translational_research&action=edit&sec
tion=4)]

In U.S., the [National Institutes of
Health](/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health) has implemented a major national
initiative to leverage existing academic health center infrastructure through
the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. The [National Center for
Advancing Translational
Sciences](/wiki/National_Center_for_Advancing_Translational_Sciences) (NCATS)
was established on December 23, 2011.[20]

Although translational research is relatively new, it is being recognized and
embraced globally. Some major centers for translational research include:

  * About 60 hubs of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards program.[21]
  * [Translational Research Institute (Australia)](/wiki/Translational_Research_Institute_\(Australia\)), [Brisbane, Queensland](/wiki/Brisbane,_Queensland), [Australia](/wiki/Australia).
  * [Stanford University Medical Center](/wiki/Stanford_University_Medical_Center), [Stanford, California](/wiki/Stanford,_California), United States.
  * [Translational Genomics Research Institute](/wiki/Translational_Genomics_Research_Institute), [Phoenix, Arizona](/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona), United States.
  * [Maine Medical Center](/wiki/Maine_Medical_Center) in [Portland, Maine](/wiki/Portland,_Maine), United States has a dedicated translational research institute.[22]
  * [Scripps Research Institute](/wiki/Scripps_Research_Institute#Scripps_Florida), [Florida](/wiki/Florida), United States, has a dedicated translational research institute.[23]
  * [UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center](/wiki/UC_Davis), [Sacramento, California](/wiki/Sacramento,_California)[24]
  * [Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh](/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh), [Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania)[25]

Additionally, translational research is now acknowledged by some universities
as a dedicated field to study a PhD or graduate certificate in, in a medical
context. These institutes currently include [Monash
University](/wiki/Monash_University) in [Victoria,
Australia](/wiki/Victoria,_Australia),[26] the [University of
Queensland](/wiki/University_of_Queensland), Diamantina Institute in
[Brisbane, Australia](/wiki/Brisbane,_Australia),[27] at [Duke
University](/wiki/Duke_University) in [Durham, North
Carolina](/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina), [America](/wiki/United_States),[28]
at [Creighton University](/wiki/Creighton_University) in [Omaha,
Nebraska](/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska)[29] at [Emory
University](/wiki/Emory_University) in [Atlanta,
Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia),[30] and at [31][The George Washington
University](/wiki/The_George_Washington_University) in [Washington,
D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.). The industry and academic interactions to
promote translational science initiatives has been carried out by various
global centers such as [European Commission](/wiki/European_Commission),
[GlaxoSmithKline](/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline) and [Novartis](/wiki/Novartis)
Institute for [Biomedical Research](/wiki/Biomedical_Research).[32]

## Main

I want to thank you very much for giving me the honor of serving you as the
President of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) during 2001 and
2002. I consider myself extremely privileged for you to have placed your trust
in me.

The ACMG is the organization within clinical genetics that is responsible for
education and policy. Last year in my presidential address I argued that we
blend exacting science with compassion and advocacy in the care of our
patients, and we must work individually and collectively to ensure full and
equal access to genetic information and genetic health
professionals.[1](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR1) This year I will discuss the
critical need for medical geneticists to be the leaders in translating genomic
information for practical medical use.

The premise underlying my presentation is that for the Human Genome Project to
have its fullest impact, its products in the form of sequence and concepts
must be translated for use in clinical medicine. Translational genomics will
be the result of this endeavor, and medical geneticists should be the leaders
in this arena.

The success of translational genomics will depend on our ability to discern
the complexity of interactions among genes, gene products, and the
environment. A full understanding of this complexity will depend upon new ways
of considering genetics in the genomic era. This will require an intermingling
of concepts from biology, engineering, and information systems, and
comparisons within and between genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and
metabolomes.

We are already seeing a shifting focus in medical genetics from rare to common
diseases. I will argue, however, that translational genomics teaches us that
the differences between rare and common diseases are not so extreme, because
in fact there are a multitude of genotypes for “common disease” phenotypes. If
we are to improve significantly the care of our patients with rare and common
genetic diseases, then we must develop collaborative, multi-institutional,
protocol-driven clinical studies.

### Human Genome Project and translational genomics

Genetics has come a long way in less than 50 years, from the original
identification of the double helical structure of DNA by Watson and
Crick[2](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR2) in April 1953, to the drafts of the
human genome published by the public[3](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR3) and
private[4](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR4) efforts in February 2001.

Initiated in 1990, the completion of the public Human Genome Project was
originally planned for 2005. However, the finished sequence is anticipated for
spring 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Watson and Crick
publication.[2](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR2)

The results of the Human Genome Project will involve not only the complete
sequencing of the human genome, but also the creation of a new branch of
science and medicine, genomics, as well as a series of derivative disciplines.
If a genome is all of the DNA for an organism, then genomics is the study of
that genome and its implications. Derivative disciplines include
transcriptomics, the study of the transcriptome, representing all of the
transcripts or RNA copies of the genes in a cell, tissue, or individual;
proteomics, the study of the proteome, representing all of the proteins in a
cell, tissue, or individual; and metabolomics, the study of the metabolome,
representing all of the molecular components of a cell, tissue, or individual
that are produced by the proteins of the proteome. Additional derivative
disciplines are being and will continue to be described.

Genomics, its derivative disciplines, and the synthesis of this information
will generate the complete parts' lists and the parts' assembly instructions
for a fully functioning organism.

The promise of the Human Genome Project is improved diagnosis and treatment
through the application of genomic information and technologies, leading to
predictive medicine and individualized medical care.[5](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR5) Genomic medicine will be predictive rather than reactive. It will be
preventive in its philosophical orientation, rather than the more traditional
medical approach of responding only after acute presentation. The predictive
and preventive nature of genomic medicine will lead to screening of
populations, subpopulations, and individuals for genetic predispositions to
rare and common disorders.

Medical geneticists should be the translators for genomic medicine. The ACMG,
with its roles in education and policy formation, gives our membership the
venue in which to organize these translational efforts. We must prepare
ourselves for our roles in translational genomics by addressing the complexity
of biological systems.

### Complexity of interactions between genes, gene products, and environment

The disciplines of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are
already changing our concepts regarding the organization of biological
systems. Many of us thought of biochemical pathways as an interconnection of
enzymes and metabolites in a relatively homogeneously connected network. We
have learned that such systems are referred to as exponential networks, in
which the probability of a node's having increasing connectivity falls as an
exponential function.[6](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR6),[7](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR7) Robust biological and human-designed systems have the hub-and-spoke
architecture of scale-free networks. These scale-free networks are more
heterogeneous in their connectivity, with most nodes having one or a very few
contacts, and only rare nodes being highly connected. Examples of scale-free
networks include the Internet[6](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR6) and natural
proteomes.[8](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR8)

Scale-free networks are highly robust, meaning that it is difficult to
fragment such networks.[7](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR7) Communications between
nodes are unaffected by very high failure rates, since most of the nodes have
very low connectivity. If a node is lost, then there is a very high
probability that this node will have been connected to only one other node,
and while this connection will fail, there is a very low probability that the
overall function of the network will be compromised.

The structural features that give scale-free networks their robust properties,
however, are also the source of their vulnerability. The highly connected
nodes, although quite rare, are critical to network function. Failure of these
highly connected nodes, such as by a mutation in a biological scale-free
network, will fragment the network and threaten the survival of the network.
Considerations of the error and attack tolerance, as well as the
vulnerabilities of scale-free networks, are essential to our understanding of
the pathogenesis of genetic diseases.[7](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR7),[9](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR9) Such considerations require a global
view of an organism's functional components and their integration, informed,
for example, by a knowledge of that organism's genome, transcriptome,
proteome, and metabolome.

#### Intermingling of biology, engineering, and information systems

Our thinking about the complexity of cellular and organismic biology will
require us to move from molecular to modular concepts.[10](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR10) Within this modular view of biology, the components will have
properties that we will recognize to be similar to those in engineering and
computer science. Recent evidence has shown that a biological system may be
constructed that will function as an oscillator[11](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR11) or a toggle switch.[12](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR12) This modular view
of biology will require the formulation of new models and general principles
if we are to achieve an improved ability to appreciate and manipulate these
functional modules.[10](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR10)

The Human Genome Project is also bringing about major changes in
bioinformatics. Many think that, while the sequencing efforts represent a
major scientific accomplishment, the real “genomics revolution” is in the
ability to manage and analyze the information contained within the sequence.
The ongoing efforts in sequencing and informatics will permit translation for
improved medical care, although there is a substantial amount of work to be
done before practicable translation is available to individuals.

If the sequencing of an individual's genome would be available for $1,000,
then let us consider some of the issues that would accompany the translation
of this information for medical decision-making by that individual. For any
data acquisition there is inevitably an error rate, and this will be true for
genomic sequence. Even if the error rate is quite low, the size of the genome
is such that numerous errors are anticipated until the cost is so low that
multiple repetitions are possible. For example, if sequencing is 99.99%
accurate, this would result in an error every 10,000 nucleotides, or with a
human genome of approximately 3.2 billion base pairs the number of errors
would exceed 300,000. Interpretation of sequence variation between individuals
would have to consider differences due to technical errors as well as natural
polymorphisms. In addition, interpretation of an individual's genomic sequence
will require a better understanding of complexity in biology, from the
multiple functions of individual proteins to a modular view of biological
networks. Beyond the technical and biological considerations in the use of the
genomic sequence information are ethical, legal, and social issues. The cost
of $1,000 that we have set arbitrarily would be affordable for some and
absolutely inaccessible for others. For those who could afford to have their
genomes sequenced, there would be the issues of privacy and discrimination,
and how this information could be stored in a manner that would ensure
fidelity and accessibility without compromising
insurability.[1](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR1)

#### Comparisons within and between genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and
metabolomes

Comparisons of sequences within and between organisms may be quite powerful.
Such comparisons are quite common and useful for DNA coding sequences and
deduced amino acid sequences, for which similarities and differences define
and distinguish, for example, functional domains and gene families.
Comparisons among noncoding sequences may identify and distinguish regulatory
elements. Other conserved blocks of noncoding sequences are being recognized,
but for many of these conserved regions their functions remain to be
identified. A fuller understanding of function and interrelationships
throughout the genome, transcriptome, and proteome and their impact on the
metabolome will be required for interpretation of sequence differences within
an individual's genome.

Functional comparisons must be made at all levels, but at this time are
focusing on the proteome and metabolome. Studies in microorganisms can give us
insight into principles underlying the robustness of all biological systems.
Growth of _Escherichia coli_ on glucose was analyzed to determine which
enzymes contributed most strongly to the robust properties of this metabolic
system.[13](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR13) Flux limits for enzymatic reactions
were examined below which growth on glucose was compromised, and these enzymes
were classified into three groups: pentose phosphate pathway, three-carbon
glycolytic pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. For the pentose phosphate
pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle, growth was not compromised until
residual flux fell to ≈15–30% of normal. For the three-carbon glycolytic
pathway, however, growth was compromised when flux fell to only 63% of normal,
indicating that this region of metabolism was much more sensitive to
variation. Therefore, while growth of _E. coli_ on glucose is in general a
highly robust property, not all components are equally resistant to
perturbation.

Comparisons of the large-scale organization of metabolic networks between
organisms also may give insight into the robustness of biological systems. The
metabolic networks of 43 organisms were compared quantitatively for 43
organisms representative of archae, bacteria, and
eukaryotes.[14](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR14) Significant differences in the
pathways were observed among these organisms, but the overall design
properties were quite similar. The investigators speculated that the scale-
free topological organization was the common design-element in these organisms
and that this organization contributed to the common feature of robust
tolerance to variation among these very different organisms.

#### _DAX1_ deficiency and pertubation in a complex network

Dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenta, on the X
chromosome, gene 1 (_DAX1_), is the nuclear receptor family member encoded by
the _NROB1_ gene.[15](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR15) Loss of _DAX1_ function by
deletion or point mutation causes disruption of the normal development of the
steroidogenic axis leading to adrenal hypoplasia congenita associated with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The key question is how the loss of a single
gene product results in the compromise of a robust developmental system.

Traditionally we have thought of blocks in metabolic pathways as analogous to
the damming of a flow of water with a buildup behind the dam and overflow into
side channels, and of blocks in transcriptional cascades as interruption of
signal transfer. Consideration of the complexity of developmental networks,
however, gives us a different view of the effects of mutations. _DAX1_ is a
node in a complex network with a high level of
connectivity.[16](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR16) Loss of _DAX1_ function would
not simply compromise a one-dimensional transcriptional cascade, but we would
speculate that mutation of _DAX1_ would compromise the function of each of the
transcription factors distal to it in the network, and therefore an entire
sector of the transcriptional network would be lost.[16](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR16)

### Shifting focus from rare to common diseases

Some consider the shift in focus within medical genetics from rare, Mendelian
diseases to common, complex disorders as a paradigm shift. We must consider,
however, that rare and common disorders, or “single” gene and multigenic
diseases, respectively, represent points on a continuum and not distinct
entities.[9](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR9),[17](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR17)–[19](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR19)

#### Multitude of genotypes even for common disease phenotypes

Complexity is the rule for the phenotypes of “simple” Mendelian traits, as
well as for common, multigenic disorders.[9](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR9),[17](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR17)–[20](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR20) In
a Mendelian or “single” gene disorder, there is one gene that exerts a primary
effect, but the phenotype in the individual patient is influenced by
additional modifier genes.[17](/articles/gim200275#ref-
CR17)–[19](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR19) As a single gene loses its primary
effect and the influences of two or more genes begin to be approximately
coequal, the disorder is recognized as multigenic. Such multigenic diseases
may also be referred to as “complex” diseases, but this terminology denies the
fundamental complexity of the “single” gene diseases. The major portion of the
common disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes
mellitus, are presumed to be multigenic with superimposition of environmental
influences.

Since the phenotypes of the “simple” Mendelian disorders represent the
influences of the primary genetic abnormality and additional modifier genes,
and those for multigenic disorders clearly involve the influences of multiple
genes, and both have additional environmental influences, therefore the
phenotypes of individuals in all categories of genetic disorders will be
determined by the individuals' extended genotypes. In other words, each
individual, regardless of the type of genetic disease they experience, are
influenced by their unique genotype and environmental experience.

For Mendelian disorders, although there may be a group of modifier genes that
may influence the phenotype, not every modifier gene will be involved in each
patient. Similarly, for the multigenic disorders, if there are large groups of
genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis, only a subset of these will be
involved in any individual patient. Therefore, any genetic disease will be
composed of individuals with rare composite genotypes, and we can develop
similar approaches for the acquisition of an evidence base across all genetic
disorders.

#### Development of collaborative, multi-institutional, protocol-driven
clinical studies

The use of clinical studies involving collaborations between multiple
institutions with strict adherence to protocols developed by consensus among
the participating investigators represents the approach that will optimize
progress toward a sound evidence base when individual patients are rare. We
have determined that even for common disorders, those with an identical
composite genotype will be rare; therefore, such an approach will be just as
valid for rare disorders as for common diseases.

One example from genetics is the multi-institutional, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled investigation of the value of penicillin prophylaxis
in patients with sickle cell disease.[21](/articles/gim200275#ref-CR21)
Accumulation of a significant number of patients with sickle cell disease from
a number of centers in a carefully controlled, protocol-driven study permitted
the very clear conclusion to be drawn that penicillin did benefit patients
with sickle cell disease. In fact, the statistical power of the study was so
strong that the study was terminated earlier than anticipated when the data
indicated that the patients on placebo were at risk for sepsis and death far
in excess of those on penicillin prophylaxis. The consequence of this well-
controlled study was the conclusion by a National Institutes of Health
Consensus Development Conference that all neonates should be screened for
sickle cell disease in order to identify those with this disorder and initiate
penicillin prophylaxis to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with
clinical presentation in the absence of a diagnosis.[22](/articles/gim200275
#ref-CR22)

Perhaps the most successful example of a multi-institutional, protocol-driven
clinical collaboration is the Children's Oncology Group (COG). It is estimated
that at least 85% of children with cancer are enrolled in COG protocols, and
if those involved with natural history studies are included, the enrollment
may be as high as 95%. The involvement of such a high proportion of children
with cancer in clinical trials by COG and its predecessors permits an
iterative approach to improvements in interventions and has been credited with
the remarkable success that has been achieved in pediatric cancer outcomes.

The highly individualistic approach that characterizes much of American
medicine, including medical genetics, provides the practitioner with
management autonomy. If we argue that pooling of patients into collaborative,
protocol-driven clinical studies will facilitate progress, then the conclusion
would be that the lack of collaboration by autonomous physicians delays
progress unnecessarily. To be successful, an organized national approach to
develop collaborative studies in medical genetics will require “buy-in” by the
clinical genetics community (with associated loss of practitioner autonomy)
and adequate resources to support the protocols (including patient enrollment
and support, data analyses, and iterative interventional changes).

### Summary and conclusions

The need for translational research has received considerable recent
attention. Medical geneticists and the ACMG have the opportunity to establish
a model for translational studies for the medical community through
collaborative natural history studies and interventional clinical trials.
Medical genetics will become the clinical embodiment of the Human Genome
Project if we are successful in transliterating genomic sequences and concepts
into the language of medicine. Optimal care for our patients and those of our
colleagues in other specialties of medicine will require that medical
geneticists continue to accept the responsibility for translational genomics.

## Abstract

The genomic revolution has fundamentally changed our perception of breast
cancer. It is now apparent from DNA-based massively parallel sequencing data
that at the genomic level, every breast cancer is unique and shaped by the
mutational processes to which it was exposed during its lifetime. More than 90
breast cancer driver genes have been identified as recurrently mutated, and
many occur at low frequency across the breast cancer population. Certain
cancer genes are associated with traditionally defined histologic subtypes,
but genomic intertumoral heterogeneity exists even between cancers that appear
the same under the microscope. Most breast cancers contain subclonal
populations, many of which harbor driver alterations, and subclonal structure
is typically remodeled over time, across metastasis and as a consequence of
treatment interventions. Genomics is deepening our understanding of breast
cancer biology, contributing to an accelerated phase of targeted drug
development and providing insights into resistance mechanisms. Genomics is
also providing tools necessary to deliver personalized cancer medicine, but a
number of challenges must still be addressed. _Clin Cancer Res; 23(11);

## Introduction

Technical and analytic developments underpin major advances in our
understanding of breast cancer biology over the last two decades. The
application of gene expression arrays in the early 2000s led to a refined
molecular classification, the development of prognostic assays, and a better
characterization of the contribution of the tumor microenvironment (1, 2).
First steps toward translating molecularly defined breast cancer subsets came
from efforts using gene expression–based signatures, which have led to
multiple commercially available and clinically useful assays in hormone
receptor–positive breast cancer, and are continuing to be developed for
multiple clinical/translational applications today. Discussing RNA-based
assays is beyond the scope of the current review but was the topic of a recent
_CCR 20th Anniversary Commentary_ (2). The genomic revolution later saw the
emergence of commercially available massively parallel sequencing approaches
that permit the comprehensive profiling of an entire cancer's genome, all
coding genes (exome), or a selection of genes (targeted sequencing). DNA
sequencing technologies offer the potential to deliver personalized medicine
by matching appropriate targeted therapeutics with unique molecular
aberrations within an individual's cancer. Furthermore, massively parallel
sequencing can be used to identify biomarkers associated with response to
experimental targeted therapies, both in clinical trials and _in vitro_.

Here we consider five practical applications of the genomic revolution,
summarizing in each case what we have learned thus far and considering the
challenges that remain for future endeavors (Fig. 1). Key messages include the
following: (i) the driver landscape of breast cancer includes many rare cancer
genes and an unexpected level of inter- and intratumoral driver mutation
heterogeneity; (ii) understanding the mutational processes operating
throughout a cancer's lifetime may identify therapeutic vulnerabilities; (iii)
many genomic features align with traditional molecular and histologic subtypes
that can aid classification; (iv) cancers demonstrate subclonal
diversification that may underlie primary and acquired treatment resistance;
and (v) a range of patterns of metastatic dissemination are observed
reflecting clonal evolution.

Applications of the genomic revolution in breast cancer. Each of the five
segments represents an application of the genomic revolution, main findings
are pictured within the inner, white panel, and outstanding challenges are
summarized in the outer, blue panel. Histologic subtypes: invasive ductal
cancer (IDC) and invasive lobular cancer (ILC).

## Application 1: Characterizing the Driver Landscape of Breast Cancer

To date, almost 100 high-probability breast cancer driver genes have been
identified through the application of computational approaches to massively
parallel sequence data generated from more than 4,000 primary breast cancer
samples (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 3–18). Cancer genes have been
identified based upon somatic mutation recurrence rates that exceed
expectation after taking into account features such as background mutation
rate and spectrum, nucleotide context, enrichment in phosphorylation-specific
regions or tertiary protein structures, and the ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous mutations (19–24). Various alternative methodologies exist such as
those that adopt subnetwork analyses to identify groups of potential cancer
genes by incorporating pathway or gene interaction information, and these may
be particularly useful for identifying very rare driver genes (25–28).

Saturation analyses predict that based on the number of samples now sequenced,
most cancer genes implicated in 2% or more breast cancers will have been
identified (29). However, we expect that many more low-frequency cancer genes
remain to be discovered, because there is emerging evidence, as discussed
below, that metastatic, pretreated, male, and special histopathologic subtypes
of cancers are genomically distinct from the “general” breast cancer
population (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Table S1; refs. 6, 10–18, 30–37).
Rare “populations” are often the most clinically challenging to treat, and
further focused driver discovery exercises in these groups are warranted.

Table 2.

Key genomic findings in rare histologic subtypes (massively parallel
sequencing)

Driver alterations refer to events that are predicted to inactivate tumor
suppressor genes or activate oncogenes—common mechanisms in the former include
homozygous deletions, truncating point mutations, or disrupting rearrangements
and in the latter, focal amplifications and activating missense mutations,
typically within mutational hotspots. A recent genome-wide analysis of 560
breast cancers (9) reported that the average cancer contains three such driver
alterations (range = 0–14) and, consistent with other series, confirmed that
only a handful of cancer genes are mutated in more than 10% of breast cancers
(3–10). The most frequently implicated cancer genes (and their frequencies)
across the 560 breast cancers are _TP53_ (41%), _PIK3CA_ (30%), _MYC_ (20%),
_PTEN_ (16%), _CCND1_ (16%), _ERBB2_ (13%), _FGFR1_ (11%), and _GATA3_ (10%;
ref. 9). Because most cancer genes are mutated in less than 5% of cancers,
considerable interpatient heterogeneity exists (4, 7). By example, whole-exome
sequencing of 100 breast cancers identified driver point mutations and copy
number changes in 40 genes in 73 combinations, indicating that at the driver
gene level, most primary breast cancers are distinct (4). The wide range of
possible driver combinations within an individual cancer will demand
systematic approaches to facilitate target prioritization and guide
combination therapy approaches if we reach a position where a large number of
effective therapeutic targets are available.

The majority of driver events detected in a primary tumor are clonal, being
present in all tumor cells. However, subclones are common, and these can
harbor driver events that alter some of the most common and most frequently
clonal breast cancer genes including _TP53, MYC, PIK3CA_, and _HER2_, in
addition to rarer cancer genes such as _FGFR2_ and _RUNX1_ (3, 35, 36, 38,
39). In a multiregion sampling study, we identified subclonal, potentially
targetable alterations in 13 of 50 primary breast cancers and demonstrated
that subclones can be spatially separated, posing a challenge to
representative sampling (36). In a quarter of these cases, we identified
parallel evolution, with the same cancer gene mutated multiple times in
different subclones in the same tumor, indicating that particular subclonal
aberrations within an individual cancer may be under strong selection (36).
Highlighting the clinical relevance of such a finding, in one case of
metastatic breast cancer, parallel genetic loss of _PTEN_ in multiple
metastatic sites was documented after treatment with the PI(3)Kα inhibitor
BYL719 (40). In this case, the emergence of a convergent PTEN-null
treatment–resistant phenotype provided strong rationale for targeting the
subclonal alterations; however, in general, it is not yet clear when and if we
should target subclonal alterations or if a greater benefit will be derived
from targeting clonal alterations that are present in every cancer cell.

## Challenges

Determining the range of driver events operating within an individual breast
cancer depends, to some extent, on the sequencing technology employed (Fig.
2). Targeted approaches can provide (at lower cost than whole-genome
sequencing) high-depth sequence coverage, high sensitivity, and accurate
quantification of point mutations, overcoming, to some extent, technical
challenges such as low tumor cellularity and driver mutation subclonality
(ref. 41; Fig. 2). However, targeted approaches make prior assumptions about
the range of relevant cancer genes. Furthermore, breast cancers are
characterized by frequent and often complex structural variation, and the
precise nature of structural variation can only be captured using genome-wide
sequencing (Fig. 2; ref. 42). For example, a recent study revealed that
rearrangement breakpoints disrupt tumor suppressor gene footprints more
frequently than expected, contributing to the recessive cancer gene landscape,
with the most frequently affected genes being _PTEN, RB1_, and _ARID1B_ in 7%,
5%, and 4% of the cases, respectively (9). The same study revealed that
recurrent fusion genes and noncoding driver mutations are uncommon in primary
breast cancers (9). The full contribution of structural variation to the
driver landscape of breast cancers remains to be determined. Selecting the
most appropriate technology for incorporation in clinico-genomic trials is of
paramount importance.

Figure 2.

Insights into breast cancer genomes by applying different massively parallel
sequencing (MPS) approaches. Comparison of whole-genome sequencing (WGS),
whole-exome sequencing (WES), and targeted sequencing (TS) as approaches for
exploring the breast cancer genome. Two typical but contrasting examples of
breast cancer genomes are presented. WGS reveals all genomic mutations types
as presented within the two Circos plots. Colored dots in the outer ring
represent base substitutions (Subs), copy number changes are reported in the
second ring, whereas the colored lines in the center represent structural
variant (SV), otherwise known as rearrangements. WES and TS identify only a
fraction of mutations and do not necessarily reflect the stark differences
between the two genomic landscapes pictured. The large numbers of mutations
identified by WGS permit mutation signature detection. WES identifies
typically 10 to 300 mutations, and signature analysis is unreliable at the
lower end of this range. Notably, the homologous recombination deficiency
(HRD) substitution signature is relatively subtle, and confident detection
usually demands several hundred mutations. Although not represented in this
figure, the high depth afforded by TS offers the additional advantage of
exploring subclonality by comparing different mutations' variant allele
fractions within a tumor, providing accurate copy number can be determined.
Note the reported numbers are estimates only for illustration purposes. NA,
not available.

Defining the targetable landscape of breast cancer remains in its infancy.
High-throughput functional validation approaches are indicated to determine
the significance of potential cancer genes and driver mutations (43, 44).
Importantly, the clinical viability of even some of the most common cancer
genes (present in more than 10% of cancers) as therapeutic targets remains as
yet unproven, with only _ERBB2_ and _PIK3CA_ (45) associated with objective
responses to targeted therapies and only the former demonstrating validated
and independent prognostic and predictive value (46). _TP53, GATA3_, and _MYC_
have diverse transcriptional activities, and attempts to target them both
directly and indirectly have proved difficult for various reasons, including
lack of specificity and efficiency (47–51). These targets remain an intense
area of research. For example, clinical trials assessing the activity of PIM
kinase inhibitors in _MYC_-amplified triple-negative breast cancers are now
keenly awaited following promising preclinical work that identified a
targetable synthetic lethal interaction between _PIM1_ and _MYC_ (52).

It is important to consider that the presence of an apparent target does not
necessarily predict for response. Recent phase III studies confirmed a
survival advantage associated with the use of mTOR inhibitors (53) and CDK4/6
inhibitors (54) in advanced estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancers;
however, to date, biomarkers to predict response to these agents have not been
identified. In the PALOMA 1 trial, _CCND1_ amplifications or loss of p16
failed to predict for a response to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (55). In
a retrospective analysis of the BOLERO-2 trial, progression-free survival
benefit was observed in association with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus
irrespective of the presence or absence of genomic alterations within _PIK3CA,
CCND1_, and _FGFR1_ (56). However, the extent of benefit from everolimus
varied according to the exon specific mutation (exon 20 versus exon 9),
indicating that the definition of a target may be more nuanced than initially
appreciated.

Overcoming the significant challenges of defining and ultimately targeting the
driver landscape of breast cancer will demand large-scale, international,
novel clinico-genomic screening and clinical trial strategies, as has been
discussed comprehensively elsewhere (57). It is also clear that, since many
driver alterations are ultarare in breast cancer, studies from single cases or
small case series will also be extremely valuable, particularly for exploring
extreme response or therapeutic resistance (58).

## Application 2: Dynamic Mutational Processes and Repair Deficiencies

Whole-genome sequencing identifies thousands of mutations within each cancer,
and although the majority of them are passenger events, the patterns that they
form, termed “mutational signatures,” can reveal the mutational processes that
shaped that cancer's evolution (59). A recent analysis of 560 breast cancer
whole genomes identified 20 distinct mutational signatures (9). Typically,
multiple mutational processes are identified within each individual breast
cancer, and their relative contributions may vary over time (36, 60).

## Challenges

A comprehensive overview of mutational processes in breast cancer is presented
in another article in this _CCR Focus_ section (61). In the context of
“practical applications,” the fundamental principle is that understanding the
processes that generate mutational diversity, the substrate of natural
selection, could ultimately result in strategies to oppose cancer development
and progression (62). However, for most mutational signatures, both etiology
and direct clinical utility are at this time unclear. At present, the mutation
signatures with the greatest potential clinical benefit are those that
identify deficiencies in the homologous recombination repair pathway and may
predict for sensitivity to platinum salt chemotherapies and PARP inhibitors
(63–68). Such signatures could extend the number of patients for whom such
agents may confer benefit, beyond those with germline or somatic mutations or
promoter methylation within _BRCA1/2_ and other _BRCA_-related genes (9, 69,
70), and has been used to confirm that an ER-positive tumor arising in a
_BRCA1_ carrier is related to the germline lesion rather than being a sporadic
cancer (71).

## Application 3: Supporting Molecular and Histologic Classification of Breast
Cancers

Despite considerable intertumoral heterogeneity, certain genomic patterns
align with the molecular and histologic subtypes. For example, luminal-like
/ER-positive breast cancers typically harbor mutations in _PIK3CA, GATA3_, or
_MAP3K1_ (6–8). The most commonly mutated cancer gene in basal-like/triple-
negative breast cancers is _TP53_, and this usually contains truncating
(frameshift or nonsense) mutations (72). In contrast, when _TP53_ mutations
occur in luminal-like cancers, they are usually missense mutations (8, 10,
73). Characteristic genomic changes also underlie histologic subtypes.
Recently, several consortia have genomically characterized more than 1,225
invasive lobular breast cancers (6, 10, 13, 17, 18). Lobular tumors typically
express ER and lack _HER2_ amplification, and represent the second most
frequent histologic subtype, accounting for up to 15% of all invasive breast
carcinomas (74). Lobular tumors display a distinct mutational pattern compared
with their ER-positive/HER2-negative ductal counterparts, including a higher
frequency of _CDH1_ and _PTEN_ loss and _AKT1, ERBB2, ERBB3_, and _TBX3_
mutations (6, 10, 13, 17). Furthermore, ER-positive tumors of lobular and
ductal type have a strong tendency toward _FOXA1_ or _GATA3_ mutations,
respectively, indicating that distinct genomic mechanisms of ER activation may
exist in these distinct pathologies (6, 17, 75). Distinct genomic patterns are
also characteristic of rare tumor types, including adenoid cystic, apocrine,
medullary, mucinous, metaplastic, micropapillary, and neuroendocrine tumors,
and are detailed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 (10–12, 15, 16, 18, 32,
33, 76).

## Challenges

We continue to extrapolate from global breast cancer populations to make
clinical treatment decisions for special histologic subtypes. Now, there is
growing evidence of molecular differences between these subtypes. We should,
therefore, acknowledge both molecular and histologic subtypes as relevant
pathologic covariates in future clinical and translational research. In
addition, because certain potential therapeutic targets are enriched in some
subtypes, such as _ERBB2_ and _ERBB3_ mutations in lobular carcinomas, one
could imagine that conventional pathology could be used to enhance mutational
screening for clinical trial enrollment.

## Application 4: Defining the Genomic Basis of Metastasis

Clinically overt metastasis to distant organs is currently incurable. The most
informative sequencing approaches exploring this fatal transition compare
primary tumor and metastatic deposits from the same individual (Supplementary
Table S1). Studies focused on coding mutations reveal that most of the driver
events within the primary tumor are shared with associated metastatic deposits
(77–80). This indicates that the primary tumor may be a good surrogate for the
relapse-seeding clone, which is the target for adjuvant therapies that have
the potential to improve cancer cure rates (79, 80). For example, in a study
of single metastatic deposits from 33 individuals, 87% of driver mutations and
86% of copy number aberrations were also detected in the primary tumor (79). A
recent single-cell sequencing study of disseminated tumor cells supported this
linear model of late dissemination from the primary tumor (81). Metastatic
deposits generally harbor additional private mutations, often including known
driver mutations, reflecting ongoing subclonal diversification after
dissemination (36, 77–80, 82).

A handful of published studies have started to unravel the genomic basis of
breast cancer progression and define the temporal ordering of mutations
through the analysis of the primary tumor and multiple metastatic deposits
acquired during “rapid” autopsy (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 40, 77–80,
82–84). In this context, a recent survey conducted in Australia to evaluate
patients' attitudes toward rapid autopsy and tissue donation revealed that 87%
were willing to donate tissue at death (85). So far, multiple tumor deposits
from a total of 17 breast cancer patients who underwent autopsy have been
investigated at the mutational and copy number level (40, 80, 83, 84).
Although each patient reported in these studies has her own history of
treatment and disease evolution, several messages emerge. First, given the
observed primary/metastasis and intermetastasis genomic heterogeneity, there
is no single tumor sample that recapitulates the complete disease, that is,
all the genomic alterations present in all samples from the patient (40, 80,
82–84). Second, both linear and parallel evolution from the primary tumor are
observed (Fig. 1; refs. 80, 83, 84). In some patients, there is only one
successful seeding event that gives rise to a so-called metastatic precursor
that then seeds the other metastases, possibly in a cascading manner (Fig. 1).
In other patients, multiple successful seeding events arise from the primary
tumor. Finally, evidence is accumulating that metastatic cross-seeding occurs
between established metastases (83, 84).

## Challenges

A potential limitation of the studies that investigate metastasis using a
targeted sequencing approach is that the cancer genes present in these panels
were derived almost exclusively from the study of treatment-naïve primary
tumors and, consequently, may fail to identify genes enriched or specific to
metastatic, relapsed, or pretreated cancers. Some preliminary evidence from
metastatic tumors suggests indeed that different drivers may be associated
with metastasis, and that these are drawn from an even wider range of cancer
genes than in primary tumors (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 30, 34, 79, 86).
It is conceivable that some genes only act as drivers in nuanced situations,
for example, in resisting a specific anticancer therapy, and in specific
cancer subtypes, so studies should be powered to identify rare resistance
mutations, a theme that will be explored in further detail later in this
review (34, 87–89).

Extensive work remains within this field to determine when and what driver
mutations are most relevant to the application of personalized medicine.
Exhaustive sampling of all metastatic deposits is not practical, so if
metastasis-specific mutations are clinically important, representative
sampling strategies need to be developed. Options include sampling areas of
progressive disease after treatment interventions, particularly when a mixed
response is seen, or alternatively, using “liquid biopsies” (refs. 90–92;
Supplementary Table S1). In one study, sequencing of circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) successfully identified changes in the levels of subclonal mutations
as the relevant metastatic sites responded or progressed, providing proof of
principle for the role of a liquid biopsy to monitor treatment response (90).
Such an approach can also use ctDNA to predict minimal residual disease and
relapse, potentially extending the window of opportunity for applying adjuvant
therapies to further improve cancer cure rates (93).

## Application 5: Identifying Genomic Mechanisms of Resistance to Treatment

Changes in subclonal structure have been demonstrated across treatment
interventions using cytotoxic and endocrine therapy and targeted therapies
(35–37, 40, 94). Several genomic mechanisms of resistance to various therapies
have recently been uncovered, with mutations in _ESR1_, the gene encoding the
ER, being the most described and studied in the context of endocrine
resistance (34, 87, 95–98). Mutations cluster in the ligand-binding domain of
_ESR1_ and activate ER in the absence of the estrogen ligand. These mutations
have been detected almost exclusively in the context of prior endocrine
therapy, typically with aromatase inhibitors, and more frequently where
sensitivity to prior endocrine therapy was observed (98), suggesting that
these mutations are associated with acquired, but not primary, endocrine
resistance. A recent large-scale initiative, the Metastatic Breast Cancer
Project, characterized over 140 metastatic biopsies from endocrine
therapy–treated patients and identified several acquired mutations, in
addition to _ESR1_, that may be involved in endocrine resistance, including
_AKT1, ERBB2, KRAS_, and _RB1_ alterations (99). There is also preliminary
evidence from cell-line and patient-derived xenograft models that
CDK4/6-inhibitor resistance may be mediated by loss of _RB1_ or amplification
of _CCNE1_ or _CDK6_ (100, 101).

Treatment resistance might be complicated by heterogeneity, for example,
multiple metastatic deposits from an individual may exhibit parallel evolution
of genomic resistance, whereas other metastases may not have any genomic mark
of resistance, potentially explaining the heterogeneous response to treatment
observed in the clinic (40, 83, 96–98, 102).

## Challenges

Interrogating ctDNA represents an attractive option for identifying multiple
mechanisms of resistance in different metastases. This is the strategy adopted
by the recent UK plasmaMATCH trial ([ISRCTN16945804](/external-
ref?link_type=ISRCTN&access_num=ISRCTN16945804)), a primary aim of which is to
determine whether plasma-derived ctDNA is an acceptable alternative to tumor
biopsies for mutation identification in metastatic breast cancer. A secondary
aim is to determine whether there is a clinical benefit from therapeutic
targeting of mutations identified in ctDNA. However, open questions remain
regarding the contribution of tumor deposits to ctDNA. This contribution could
be dependent on the metastatic organ, cancer proliferation rate, histology,
size of the metastasis, and response to therapy. For instance, it has been
demonstrated that brain metastases do not or poorly contribute to ctDNA in
plasma and that ctDNA from cerebrospinal fluid would offer a better
representation of the genomic alterations of brain metastases (103).

It is also important to perform comprehensive assessment of the various
pathways activated within an individual cancer rather than seeking a single
mutation in isolation (104). For example, only a fraction of patients
receiving selective PI3Kα inhibitors respond, and nonresponders tend to
demonstrate an increase in ER-dependent transcription that can be overcome in
some cases by combining the PI3Kα inhibitor with an anti-estrogen such as
tamoxifen or fulvestrant (105).

## Conclusions and Perspective

Although the genomic revolution has profoundly broadened our understanding of
the number and nature of somatic alterations within breast cancer genomes, the
clinical benefit of these discoveries remains modest. The feasibility of DNA
sequencing to direct the management of metastatic breast cancer through a
personalized cancer medicine approach has been examined in two prospective
molecular screening studies: SAFIR01/UNICANCER and MOSCATO, in the years 2011
to 2012 (106, 107). The two studies included 423 and 129 patients, and
identified potentially targetable alterations in 40% and 46% of patients with
the ability to personalize therapy in 13% and 23% of cases, respectively. Of
the patients who received targeted therapy, 9% and 20% had a partial response
and 21% and 56% had stable disease, respectively. Therefore, 3% and 15% of
patients originally screened in these two studies derived clinical benefit
from a targeted therapy, but in the absence of a control arm, we cannot infer
if the benefit exceeded that of standard of care. It is worth noting that the
SHIVA trial, which randomized 293 patients with potentially targetable
alterations to molecularly targeted versus standard therapy and found no
improvement in outcome but higher toxicity, involved last-generation targeted
agents (108). The effect of a personalized cancer medicine approach on
survival or, indeed, any other outcome remains to be determined within
randomized trials using validated biomarkers and modern targeted drugs.

Although this review has focused on genomic sequence data, it is clear that
tackling breast cancer, a complex set of diseases, will require integrated
assessment of a wide range of data types, including pathologic
characterization (such as histologic subtyping and assessment of the cellular
composition), transcriptomics, epigenetics, and proteomics, in addition to
genomics (6, 10, 109).

Most large driver discovery studies published to date include primary,
treatment-naïve cancers (Supplementary Table S1), and around 80% of these are
likely to have been cured using existing treatment strategies. Moving forward,
focus should be placed on understanding the mechanisms of both primary and
acquired treatment resistance and the genomics of metastasis that is almost
universally fatal. This should include using genomics to identify primary
breast cancers most at risk of relapse and to characterize disseminated tumor
cells that are capable of metastasis formation.

We believe that these goals can be achieved through the joint results from
many large-scale, prospective initiatives that aim to better characterize
metastases and link molecular findings with meticulously annotated clinical
and treatment information. These initiatives include the AURORA program, the
Metastatic Breast Cancer Project (<https://www.mbcproject.org/users/new>), the
UK plasmaMATCH ([ISRCTN16945804](/external-
ref?link_type=ISRCTN&access_num=ISRCTN16945804)), as well as the various rapid
autopsy programs (99, 110, 111). However, given the extensive intertumoral
heterogeneity of breast cancer, we must not dismiss the power of “n _of 1_”
studies and small case series that could deliver key insights into ultrarare
alterations and associated treatment resistance and response.

A large amount of genomic data from several thousand breast cancers has
already been generated, and further value can almost certainly be extracted
from this. For example, a combined analysis, although challenging on account
of the heterogeneity of the datasets, would have much higher power to detect
rare mutations than any individual study to date. Supporting such a
collaborative approach is the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia
Information Exchange (GENIE; <http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Pages
/aacr-project-genie.aspx#.WH6TMnCFNOC>), an international data-sharing project
that aims to collate genomic and clinical data from tens of thousands of
patients in multiple institutions.

Great enthusiasm accompanied the initial years of the genomic revolution as a
flood of novel insights into the breast cancer genome were presented in quick
succession. We now have a clearer idea not only of the potential clinical
applications of genomics but also of the scale and nature of the challenges
that must be surmounted to bring maximum benefit to breast cancer patients. It
is clear that delivering personalized breast cancer treatments to all patients
in the future will only be possible if we focus on collaborative and
integrative approaches now.

# Genetics vs. Genomics Fact Sheet

Genetics and genomics both play roles in health and disease. Genetics refers
to the study of genes and the way that certain traits or conditions are passed
down from one generation to another. Genomics describes the study of all of a
person's genes (the genome).

## What are genetics and genomics?

Genetics is a term that refers to the study of genes and their roles in
inheritance - in other words, the way that certain traits or conditions are
passed down from one generation to another. Genetics involves scientific
studies of genes and their effects. Genes (units of heredity) carry the
instructions for making proteins, which direct the activities of cells and
functions of the body. Examples of genetic or inherited disorders include
cystic fibrosis (See: [Learning About Cystic
Fibrosis](https://www.genome.gov/10001213/learning-about-cystic-fibrosis/)),
Huntington's disease ([Learning About Huntington's
Disease](https://www.genome.gov/10001215/learning-about-huntingtons-
disease/)), and phenylketonuria (PKU) ([Learning About
Phenylketonuria](https://www.genome.gov/25020037/learning-about-
phenylketonuria/)).

Genomics is a more recent term that describes the study of all of a person's
genes (the genome), including interactions of those genes with each other and
with the person's environment. Genomics includes the scientific study of
complex diseases such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer because
these diseases are typically caused more by a combination of genetic and
environmental factors than by individual genes. Genomics is offering new
possibilities for therapies and treatments for some complex diseases, as well
as new diagnostic methods.

## Why are genetics and genomics important to my health?

Genetics and genomics both play roles in health and disease. Genetics helps
individuals and families learn about how conditions such as sickle cell anemia
and cystic fibrosis are inherited in families, what screening and testing
options are available, and, for some genetic conditions, what treatments are
available. (See: [Frequently Asked Questions About Genetic
Disorders](https://www.genome.gov/19016930/faq-about-genetic-disorders/))

Genomics is helping researchers discover why some people get sick from certain
infections, environmental factors, and behaviors, while others do not. For
example, there are some people who exercise their whole lives, eat a healthy
diet, have regular medical checkups, and die of a heart attack at age 40.
There are also people who smoke, never exercise, eat unhealthy foods and live
to be 100. Genomics may hold the key to understanding these differences.

Apart from accidents (such as falls, motor vehicle accidents or poisoning),
genomic factors play a role in nine of the ten leading causes of death in the
United States (for example, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. See: [Leading
Causes of Death](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/FASTATS/lcod.htm) [cdc.gov]). All
human beings are 99.9 percent identical in their genetic makeup. Differences
in the remaining 0.1 percent hold important clues about the causes of
diseases. Gaining a better understanding of the interactions between genes and
the environment by means of genomics is helping researchers find better ways
to improve health and prevent disease, such as modifying diet and exercise
plans to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people who carry
genetic predispositions to developing this disease.

## Why are genetics and genomics important to my family's health?

Understanding more about diseases caused by a single gene (using genetics) and
complex diseases caused by multiple genes and environmental factors (using
genomics) can lead to earlier diagnoses, interventions, and targeted
treatments. A person's health is influenced by his/her family history and
shared environmental factors. This makes family history an important,
personalized tool that can help identify many of the causative factors for
conditions that also have a genetic component. The family history can serve as
the cornerstone for learning about genetic and genomic conditions in a family,
and for developing individualized approaches to disease prevention,
intervention, and treatment. (See: [My Family Health
Portrait](https://www.genome.gov/17516481/the-us-surgeon-generals-family-

## What are some of the new genetic and genomic techniques and technologies?

**Proteomics**

The suffix "-ome" comes from the Greek for _all_, _every_, or _complete_. It
was originally used in "genome," which refers to all the genes in a person or
other organism. Due to the success of large-scale biology projects such as the
sequencing of the human genome, the suffix "-ome" is now being used in other
research contexts. Proteomics is an example. The DNA sequence of genes carries
the instructions, or code, for building proteins. This DNA is transcribed into
a related molecule, RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Proteomics,
therefore, is a similar large-scale analysis of all the proteins in an
organism, tissue type, or cell (called the proteome). Proteomics can be used
to reveal specific, abnormal proteins that lead to diseases, such as certain
forms of cancer.

**Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics**

The terms "pharmacogenetics" and "pharmacogenomics" are often used
interchangeably in describing the intersection of pharmacology (the study of
drugs, or pharmaceuticals) and genetic variability in determining an
individual's response to particular drugs. The terms may be distinguished in
the following way.

Pharmacogenetics is the field of study dealing with the variability of
responses to medications due to variation in single genes. Pharmacogenetics
takes into account a person's genetic information regarding specific drug
receptors and how drugs are transported and metabolized by the body. The goal
of pharmacogenetics is to create an individualized drug therapy that allows
for the best choice and dose of drugs. One example is the breast cancer drug
trastuzumab (Herceptin). This therapy works only for women whose tumors have a
particular genetic profile that leads to overproduction of a protein called
HER2. (See: [Genetics, Disease Prevention and
Treatment](https://www.genome.gov/19016938/faq-about-genetics-disease-
prevention-and-treatment/))

Pharmacogenomics is similar to pharmacogenetics, except that it typically
involves the search for variations in multiple genes that are associated with
variability in drug response. Since pharmacogenomics is one of the large-scale
"omic" technologies, it can examine the entirety of the genome, rather than
just single genes. Pharmacogenomic studies may also examine genetic variation
among large groups of people (populations), for example, in order to see how
different drugs might affect different racial or ethnic groups.

Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies are leading to drugs that can be
tailor-made for individuals, and adapted to each person's particular genetic
makeup. Although a person's environment, diet, age, lifestyle, and state of
health can also influence that person's response to medicines, understanding
an individual's genetic makeup is key to creating personalized drugs that work
better and have fewer side effects than the one-size-fits-all drugs that are
common today. (See: [Genetics, Disease Prevention and
Treatment](https://www.genome.gov/19016938/faq-about-genetics-disease-
prevention-and-treatment/)). For example, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) recommends genetic testing before giving the chemotherapy
drug mercaptopurine (Purinethol) to patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia. Some people have a genetic variant that interferes with their
ability to process this drug. This processing problem can cause severe side
effects, unless the standard dose is adjusted according to the patient's
genetic makeup. (See: [Frequently Asked Questions about
Pharmacogenomics](https://www.genome.gov/27530645/faq-about-
pharmacogenomics/)).

**Stem Cell Therapy**

Stem cells have two important characteristics. First, stem cells are
unspecialized cells that can develop into various specialized body cells.
Second, stem cells are able to stay in their unspecialized state and make
copies of themselves. Embryonic stem cells come from the embryo at a very
early stage in development (the blastocyst staqe). The stem cells in the
blastocyst go on to develop all of the cells in the complete organism. Adult
stem cells come from more fully developed tissues, like umbilical cord blood
in newborns, circulating blood, bone marrow or skin.

Medical researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to repair or
replace damaged body tissues, similar to whole organ transplants. Embryonic
stem cells from the blastocyst have the ability to develop into every type of
tissue (skin, liver, kidney, blood, etc.) found in an adult human. Adult stem
cells are more limited in their potential (for example, stem cells from liver
may only develop into more liver cells). In organ transplants, when tissues
from a donor are placed into the body of a patient, there is the possibility
that the patient's immune system may react and reject the donated tissue as
"foreign." However, by using stem cells, there may be less risk of this immune
rejection, and the therapy may be more successful.

Stem cells have been used in experiments to form cells of the bone marrow,
heart, blood vessels, and muscle. Since the 1990's, umbilical cord blood stem
cells have been used to treat heart and other physical problems in children
who have rare metabolic conditions, or to treat children with certain anemias
and leukemias. For example, one of the treatment options for [childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/child
ALL/Patient/page1) [cancer.gov] is stem cell transplantation therapy.

There has been much debate nationally about the use of embryonic stem cells,
especially about the creation of human embryos for use in experiments. In
1995, Congress enacted a ban on federal financing for research using human
embryos. However, these restrictions have not stopped researchers in the
United States and elsewhere from using private funding to create new embryonic
cell lines and undertaking research with them. The embryos for such research
are typically obtained from embryos that develop from eggs that have been
fertilized _in vitro_ \- as in an _in vitro_ fertilization clinic - and then
donated for research purposes with informed consent of the donors. In 2009,
some of the barriers to federal financing of responsible and scientifically
worthy human stem cell research were lifted.

**Cloning**

Cloning can refer to genes, cells, or whole organisms. In the case of a cell,
a clone refers to any genetically identical cell in a population that comes
from a single, common ancestor. For example, when a single bacterial cell
copies its DNA and divides thousands of times, all of the cells that are
formed will contain the same DNA and will be clones of the common ancestor
bacterial cell. Gene cloning involves manipulations to make multiple identical
copies of a single gene from the same ancestor gene. Cloning an organism means
making a genetically identical copy of all of the cells, tissues, and organs
that make up the organism. There are two major types of cloning that may
relate to humans or other animals: therapeutic cloning and reproductive
cloning.

Therapeutic cloning involves growing cloned cells or tissues from an
individual, such as new liver tissue for a patient with a liver disease. Such
cloning attempts typically involve the use of stem cells. The nucleus will be
taken from a patient's body cell, such as a liver cell, and inserted into an
egg that has had its nucleus removed. This will ultimately produce a
blastocyst whose stem cells could then be used to create new tissue that is
genetically identical to that of the patient.

Reproductive cloning is a related process used to generate an entire animal
that has the same nuclear DNA as another currently or previously existing
animal. The first cloned animals were frogs. Dolly, the famous sheep, is
another example of cloning. The success rates of reproductive animal cloning,
however, have been very low. In 2005, South Korean researchers claimed to have
produced human embryonic stem cell lines by cloning genetic material from
patients. However, this data was later reported to have been falsified.
